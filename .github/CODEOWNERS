# foo/bar/* <-- foo/bar/index.ts, but *not* foo/bar/baz/index.ts

# The file is interpreted from end to start, only the first match is taken.
# An entry of "foo/ @team1", then "foo/bar.txt @team2",
# means that only @team2 is the owner of bar.txt.

# Multiple owners means "request all, but only any one required".
# Do not use multiple owners.

# Please try and keep the file sorted.

# Fix

`snyk fix --agentic` is a new LLM-driven command. It is distinct from the legacy `snyk fix` command, which used a deterministic fix engine and is deprecated.

## Prerequisites

To use the `snyk fix --agentic` command:

* Install Snyk CLI v1.1307.4 or later. Visit [Install or update the Snyk CLI](../install-the-snyk-cli/README.md).
* [Authenticate](auth.md) your machine with the Snyk CLI using `snyk auth`
* Configure access to an LLM provider. Not every provider uses an API key. Visit [Remediation Agent](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-fix-and-prevent/fix/remediation-agent) for the supported providers and their setup instructions.

## Usage

`snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca|--sast|--container [<OPTIONS>] [<PATH>]`

## Description

The `snyk fix --agentic` command scans your Project for vulnerabilities, generates a fix plan, and walks you through applying and verifying each fix. Use `--auto-approve` to apply fixes without prompting.

Choose what to remediate with a product flag:

* `--sca`: Snyk Open Source. Fixes vulnerable dependencies by bumping versions and adding overrides.
* `--sast`: Snyk Code. Applies Snyk Agent Fix suggestions for source code vulnerabilities and rescans to confirm the vulnerability is resolved.
* `--container`: Snyk Container. Bumps Dockerfile base images and patches OS packages, then builds and rescans the image to verify the result.

Pass exactly one of `--sca`, `--sast`, or `--container`. The `--experimental` flag is required alongside `--agentic`.

Visit [Remediation Agent](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-fix-and-prevent/fix/remediation-agent) for setup instructions and supported IDEs.

Some options on this page are available only in the latest preview release of the Snyk CLI. Run `snyk version` to check your version.

## Exit codes

Possible exit codes and their meaning:

**0**: Success. Vulnerabilities were remediated.\
**1**: Action needed. Some vulnerabilities could not be fixed.\
**2**: Failure. An error occurred. Use `-d` to output the debug logs.

## Configure the Snyk CLI

You can use environment variables to configure the Snyk CLI and set variables for connecting with the Snyk API. For more information see [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli)

## Code execution warning

Before scanning your code, review the [Code execution warning for Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/code-execution-warning-for-snyk-cli)

## Debug

Use the `-d` option to output the debug logs.

## Options

### `--agentic`

Enable the LLM-driven fix flow. Required to use this command in agentic mode.

### `--experimental`

Acknowledge the release status of the command. Required alongside `--agentic`.

### `--sca`

Fix Snyk Open Source (dependency) vulnerabilities. Mutually exclusive with `--sast` and `--container`.

### `--sast`

Fix Snyk Code (source code) vulnerabilities. Mutually exclusive with `--sca` and `--container`.

### `--container`

Fix Snyk Container vulnerabilities by editing a single Dockerfile: bump the base image and patch OS packages. Mutually exclusive with `--sca` and `--sast`, and requires `--agentic`.

**Note:** Because the container flow selects fixes at the Dockerfile and package level rather than per vulnerability, it does not accept `--issue-ids`, `--exclude-ids`, `--severity-threshold`, or `--severity-filter`. Passing any of them ends the run before the scan starts.

### `--provider=<PROVIDER>`

Set the LLM provider to use.\
Allowed values: `anthropic`, `openai`, `bedrock`, `vertex`, `litellm`, `ollama`\
Default: `anthropic`

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --provider=openai`

### `--model=<MODEL>`

Set the model ID, which overrides the provider's default model. Required for Ollama, for example `llama3.1`. For Vertex AI, use a Gemini or Claude model name, for example `gemini-2.5-flash`. Visit [Configure a model provider](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-fix-and-prevent/fix/remediation-agent#configure-a-model-provider) for Amazon Bedrock model ID guidance.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --provider=ollama --model=llama3.1`

### `--dry-run`

Show the fix plan without applying changes.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --dry-run`

### `--auto-approve`

Run without prompting.\
**Important:** In addition to approving fixes, this option trusts the folder, continues after test failures, skips advisories, and approves partial plans when the agent reaches a budget warning.

### `--issue-ids=<ID>[,<ID>]...`

Fix only the listed IDs, as a comma-separated list. Accepts both SCA vulnerability IDs and SAST finding IDs.\
**Note:** Requires `--auto-approve`, and does not combine with `--exclude-ids`. The command exits with a nonzero code if any requested ID is not fixed.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --issue-ids=SNYK-JS-FOO-123,SNYK-JS-BAR-456`

### `--exclude-ids=<ID>[,<ID>]...`

Exclude the listed IDs from the run, as a comma-separated list, so the agent fixes everything else. Accepts both SCA vulnerability IDs and SAST finding IDs.\
**Note:** Requires `--auto-approve`, and does not combine with `--issue-ids`. An SCA fix group is skipped only when all of its IDs are excluded.

### `--severity-threshold=<SEVERITY>`

Fix only vulnerabilities at or above this severity.\
Allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`\
**Note:** Requires `--auto-approve`.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --severity-threshold=high`

### `--severity-filter=<SEVERITY>[,<SEVERITY>]...`

Fix only vulnerabilities whose severity is exactly one of these.\
Allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`\
**Note:** Unlike `--severity-threshold`, this is an exact match, and it applies to interactive runs as well as auto-approved ones.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --severity-filter=high,critical`

### `--breakability-filter=<RATING>[,<RATING>]...`

Fix only SCA fixes whose assessed breakability is exactly one of these.\
Allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`\
**Note:** Applies to Snyk Open Source only, so it skips the SAST leg.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --breakability-filter=low`

### `--no-breakability`

Skip the Snyk Breakability API and use the local heuristic only.

### `--enable-revert`

Roll a fix's edits back when it fails, instead of keeping them.\
Default: off, so failed fixes are kept and reported\
**Note:** A test failure always keeps the fix.

### `--fix-report=<PATH>`

Write a JSON report of fixed and not-fixed vulnerabilities, including ID, title, and severity, to this file path.

### `--ci`

Produce plain output suited to a CI log, with no colors or spinner.\
**Note:** This option also disables parent-package fix discovery.

### `--agent-max-iterations=<N>`

Limit how many iterations the agent runs per fix.\
Default: `0`, which uses the built-in limit of 50

### `--max-validation-attempts=<N>`

Limit the number of validation retry attempts per fix. After this many failed test runs, the agent skips the fix and moves on.\
Default: `0`, which uses the built-in default

### `--additional-params="<PARAMS>"`

Pass extra arguments to the Snyk Open Source scan.

Example: `snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --additional-params="--exclude=vendor --detection-depth=3"`

### `-d`, `--debug`

Print debug information to stderr.

## Examples for the `snyk fix` command

### Fix open source dependencies interactively

```bash
snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca
```

### Preview a fix plan

```bash
snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --dry-run
```

### Use a local model

```bash
snyk fix --agentic --experimental --sca --provider=ollama --model=llama3.1
```

### Fix container vulnerabilities

```bash
snyk fix --agentic --experimental --container
```

# COS gateway create

## Usage

`snyk cos gateway create [<OPTIONS>]`

## Description

The `snyk cos gateway create` command creates a gateway and prints its ID, name, and state, followed by its node token.

The node token is the credential that the gateway process uses to authenticate its tunnel. **The token is shown once.** The service does not store it and cannot return it again. If you lose the token, delete the gateway and create another.

# COS gateway

## Usage

`snyk cos gateway [<COMMAND>] [<OPTIONS>]`

## Description

The `snyk cos gateway` allows you to manage gateways. A gateway is an agent you run inside your network so that scans can reach private targets: private addresses and internal or single-label names such as `jira.corp` or `intranet`, resolved by the gateway in its network.

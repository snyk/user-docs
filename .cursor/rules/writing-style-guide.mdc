# Writing style guide

When editing docs in this repo, follow the style guide in:

- `.cursor/rules/writing-rules-style-guide.md`

If you're about to make substantial edits to a doc page, read that file first and apply it to:

- audience/persona and scannability
- global, inclusive, bias-free language
- accessibility (alt text, no color-only cues, avoid left/right/above/below references)
- grammar/tone (active voice, present tense, avoid filler)
- UI writing conventions (bold UI text, navigation with `Settings > Notifications`)
- preferred word choices and standard casing (see the replacements table)

## Audience (persona)

If you reach for too many audiences, you'll miss them all. How you write to an advanced user will always differ from how you write to a novice. The same goes for personas. An AppSec user loves the power of Snyk, whereas a developer cares about ease of use within their workflow.

- **Writing to a developer new to security?** Explain the basics clearly and provide easy-to-follow steps.

- **Writing to a CISO looking for a new SAST?** Don't waste time on basic definitions. Show how Snyk overcomes the limitations of existing tools.

## Core principles

- **Write for scannability:** Users scan, they don't read. They decide quickly if content is relevant. Structure your content to help them, using clear headings, short paragraphs, and lists.

- **Give the conclusion first (inverted pyramid):** Write the key points and answers first. This lets users get the most important information immediately and decide if they want to read the supporting details.

- **Use headings as keywords:** Headings and subheadings should be short, use keywords users would search for, and help users understand the content at a glance. Avoid starting a topic with vague phrases like "This guide describes"; the title should make the topic clear.

- **Use content chunks:** Use short, digestible paragraphs. Ensure there is enough white space between "chunks" to help users scan and identify what they need.

- **Omit needless words:** Make every word count. Avoid filler words that don't add meaning.
  - **Good:** Follow these steps to change your password.
  - **Bad:** Follow these steps **in order to** change your password.

## Global, inclusive, and bias-free communication

Snyk reaches a global audience. Content must be respectful, inclusive, and easy to understand for everyone, including non-native English speakers.

- **Inclusive language:** Do not use terms that may show bias regarding gender, race, culture, ability, or age.

  - Use gender-neutral terms (for example, "chairperson" instead of "chairman").

  - Use "they/them" as the default non-gendered pronoun.

  - Portray people with disabilities positively. Use "people with disabilities" instead of "the disabled".

  - Use "allowlist" instead of "whitelist" and "blocklist" instead of "blacklist".

- **Avoid slang, jargon, and idioms:** Avoid slang, jargon, local terms, and colloquialisms. Do not use U.S.-centric sports or military metaphors (for example, avoid "hit a home run" or "demilitarized zone").

- **Avoid non-English words:** Do not use Latin or other non-English phrases, even if they seem common.

  - Use "for example" instead of "e.g.".

  - Use "that is" instead of "i.e.".

  - Use "and so on" instead of "etc.".

  - Use "through" or "using" instead of "via".

- **Language (US English):** Default to US English spelling and grammar.

  - **US:** analyze

  - **non-US:** analyse

- **Be careful with art:** Images present globalization issues. Avoid hand signs, holiday themes, or specific flags that could be offensive or misunderstood in other cultures.

## Accessibility

Content must be easy for everyone to use, including people with disabilities.

- **Provide alternative text (alt text):** All non-text elements (graphics, video) must have descriptive alternative (alt) text so they are accessible to screen readers.

- **Don't use color alone:** Do not use color as the *only* way to convey information (for example, "click the green button"). This is inaccessible to users with color blindness.

- **Avoid vague directional cues:** Do not use directional terms (like "left," "right," "above," or "below") as the *only* clue to location. This is confusing for users who rely on screen readers.

  - **Good:** In the **Save As** dialog box, click **OK**.

  - **Bad:** In the dialog box on the left, click **OK**.

- **Document all keyboard shortcuts:** Document all keyboard shortcuts for users who cannot use a mouse.

## Grammar, style, and tone

### Active voice

Use active voice and avoid passive voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action.

- **Active (good):** Patch logged into the account.

- **Active (good):** **You can** change your password.

- **Passive (bad):** The account was logged into by Patch.

- **Passive (bad):** **This functionality enables the users to** change their passwords.

### Tense

Use the present tense unless you have no choice. Avoid future tense like "will be" and imprecise words like "currently".

- **Good:** After you click **Start**, the start screen appears.

- **Bad:** After you click **Start**, the start screen **will appear**.

### Pronouns

- Write in the first person plural ("we," "us") or second person ("you") instead of "I".

- When possible, avoid pronouns entirely by using imperatives (commands).
  - **Best:** Click **Start** to begin the scan.
  - **Good:** Now **we** can see the full list of vulnerabilities.
  - **Bad:** Now **I** can see the full list of vulnerabilities.

### Avoid modal verbs

Modal verbs (may, should, might) add uncertainty. Use them sparingly.

- **Good:** Snyk identifies vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

- **Bad:** Snyk **should** identify vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

### Avoid "please"

Avoid using **please**. It is often unnecessary and can sound condescending. Use it only for situations that are inconvenient for the user (like waiting) or when the software is at fault.

**Good:** Click **Save**.
**Bad:** **Please** click the **Save** button.

### Avoid subjective and filler words

Do not use subjective terms like **simply**, **easy**, or **fast**. What is easy for one user may be difficult for another. Avoid meaningless filler words like "just", "actually", or "literally".

- **Good:** To publish, click **Publish to Web**.

- **Bad:** To publish, **simply** click **Publish to Web**.

### Brand possessives

Avoid using possessives for brand names.

- **Good:** The Priority Score feature in Snyk Code ranks vulnerabilities.

- **Bad:** Snyk Code's Priority Score ranks vulnerabilities.

### Lists

List type

- Use **bulleted lists** when order is unimportant.

- Use **numbered lists** for a sequence of steps (procedures).

Procedure steps

Use the **imperative mood** (a command) for steps in a numbered list.

**Good:**

1.  Click **Start**.

2.  Type your password.

**Bad:**

1.  You **should click** the **Start** button.

2.  Then you **will type** your password.

Parallel construction

Use parallel construction for all list items. If you start one item with a verb, start all items with a verb of the same tense.

- **Good:** Snyk can find vulnerabilities, suggest fixes, and recommend updates.

- **Bad:** Snyk is great for finding vulnerabilities, base image update reporting, and secure coding.

Punctuation and capitalization

- If items are complete sentences, capitalize the first word and end with a period.

- If items are fragments that complete the introductory sentence, start with a lowercase letter and use no end punctuation.

- Do not add commas (,) or semicolons (;) to the end of list items.

### Formatting and punctuation

Placeholders

Use *italics* for placeholder values that the user must replace with their own information.

*Example:* git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
*Example:* Go to Settings \> Organization \> *your-org-name*.

Spacing

Use **one space** after a period, not two.

Ampersands (&)

Do not use ampersands, unless required by a space limit.

Apostrophes (')

Do not use apostrophes in plurals of abbreviations or dates (for example, "APIs" or "1990s").

Colons (:)

- Use colons to introduce lists.

- When a colon is used in a sentence, the first word following it is lowercase unless it is a proper noun.

- Capitalize the first word after a colon in a title.

#### Commas (,)

- Default to using the serial (Oxford) comma.

- Avoid comma splices.
  - **Good:** Snyk is a security platform. It helps developers code securely.
  - **Bad:** Snyk is a security platform, it helps developers code securely.

Dashes and hyphens

- **Hyphen (-):** Use to combine words (for example, "client-side" or "read-only"). Do not hyphenate adverbs ending in -ly.

- **En Dash (–):** Use to indicate a range, meaning "through" (for example, "pages 37–59" or "Dec 9–Jan 1").

- **Em Dash (—):** Use to create a strong break in a sentence. Put spaces on both sides of an em dash.

Exclamation points (!)

Use sparingly. Overexcitement reads as disingenuous.

Semicolons (;)

Use sparingly. They often signal an overcomplicated sentence.

#### Plurals (s)

Do not use parentheses (s) to indicate a plural. Use the plural form.

- **Good:** ...displays one or more repositories.

- **Bad:** ...displays the repository(s).

### Word choice and usage

Names

- **Snyk:** Snyk **Projects** are always capitalized.

- **Products:** Node.js, Composer, .NET, dep.

Numbers

- Spell out numbers one through nine.

- Use numerals for 10 and greater.

- **Exception:** Always use numerals for measurements (3 cm), time, or in lists with other numerals.

Avoid "once"

Avoid using "once" to mean "after." It can be confusing.

- **Good:** **After** you enter the details, click **XYZ**.

- **Bad:** **Once** you enter the details, click **XYZ**.

Place "only" carefully

"Only" comes immediately before the thing it limits.

#### Simple > complex

- Use "use" instead of "utilize".

- Use "start" instead of "commence".

- Use "before" instead of "prior to" or "in advance of".

- Use "if" instead of "in the event that".

- Use "ensure" instead of "make sure".

- Use "first" instead of "first of all".

- Use "and" instead of "and/or".

### Documenting the user interface (UI)

UI elements include all text on the screen, such as buttons, check boxes, menus, tabs, and window titles.

Formatting UI elements

Use **bold** to emphasize UI elements. Match the capitalization of the UI element exactly.

- **Good:** Click **Start** to scan for vulnerabilities.

- **Good:** Navigate to **ORGANIZATION SETTINGS**.

  - **Example:** Project monitoring was successfully stopped, but the webhook could not be removed. Ask the repository owner to delete the webhook.

- **Warnings:** A warning message must tell the user what the problem is and how to fix it.

  - **Example:** This organization is at the limit of the Starter plan. Any new projects will be inactive. Please upgrade.

- **Errors:** An error message must be informative.

  - **Example:** Sorry, the page could not be found. It might be an old link or it may have moved.

### Abbreviations and acronyms

- Spell out an abbreviation or acronym the first time you use it, followed by the short version in parentheses.
  - **First use:** static application security testing (SAST)
  - **Second use:** SAST

- **Exception:** If the abbreviation is universally known (like API or HTML), you do not need to spell it out.

- **CI/CD:** Use a slash, not a space.

- See the Snyk Terms list for common acronyms.

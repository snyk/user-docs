# Breakdown of Code analysis

When you import repositories, Snyk Code automatically tests for vulnerabilities within the imported code. The vulnerabilities detected across all files in a single repository are compiled into a Snyk Project, labeled as Code Analysis. Code Analysis presents the test outcome for a specific repository, listing all discovered vulnerabilities in the repository's source code.

## Data flow

Data flow shows the location of the discovered issue in your source code and how it flows throughout your application. It shows the taint flow of the issue in the code, with a step-by-step visualization from the source to the sink, presenting the code lines of all the steps in the flow.

The source is the input point of the potential problem. This is a point in the application where a user or an external device can enter data, which will potentially violate the security of the application. For example, in an SQL Injection issue, the source will be a form or any other data input area filled by a user.

The sink is the operation in the code where the application executes the problem. This point must receive clean input, or it can be exploited. For example, in an SQL Injection issue, the sink will be the internal operation that instructs the DB to perform certain actions according to the received input.

Every issue discovered by Snyk Code has a data flow. If an issue has only one step, for example, in the case of hardcoded secrets, the source of the issue will be displayed on the Data flow page.

### View Data flow

1. Log in to the Snyk Web UI and select your [Group and Organization](../../../snyk-admin/groups-and-organizations/).
2. Navigate to the **Projects** and select the Target folder containing your repository's Projects.
3. Open **Code analysis** Project.
4. (Optional) [Search or filter for a specific vulnerability issue](./#vulnerability-issues).
5. Select a vulnerability issue and navigate to **Full details** > **Data flow**.
6. As part of the Data flow analysis, you can take the following actions:

* View the taint flow of an issue in your code from source to sink. See [Data flow analysis example](breakdown-of-code-analysis.md#data-flow-analysis-example).
* [Open Data flow external link in the integrated Git repository](breakdown-of-code-analysis.md#open-data-flow-external-link).
* Ignore the open vulnerability issue using the **Ignore** button. See [Ignore issues](../../../manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/ignore-issues/).

### Data flow analysis example

In the following Path Traversal issue, the developer has not sanitized the input. This allows an attacker to perform a pass traversal attack to access any file in the file system, including sensitive data such as password files.

## Severity score factors

Snyk Code reports issues by severity levels: High, Medium, and Low. Snyk Code currently does not use the Critical severity level. The severity score is based on the following factors:

* Qualities intrinsic to a vulnerability
* Evolution of vulnerability over a lifetime

### Exceptions

If a vulnerability is detected in code, filename, or folder with the word `test`, it is deemed a low-severity vulnerability. This applies to all languages. The severity of CWEs may change depending on the environment.

## Priority score factors

Use the Priority Score to filter and prioritize discovered issues based on their importance, risk, frequency, and availability of a Fix analysis.

A Priority Score for each issue can be between 0 and 1,000, which changes automatically if one of its factors changes. For example, if the Severity Level of an issue has increased or decreased, the Priority Score of the issue changes accordingly.

You can filter issues in the Code analysis Project by Priority Score using the **PRIORITY SCORE** slider to set the range of the scores you want to display (see [View issues by Priority Score](../../../manage-risk/prioritize-issues-for-fixing/priority-score.md#view-issues-by-priority-score)).

<table><thead><tr><th width="209">Priority Score factor</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="breakdown-of-code-analysis.md#severity-score-factors"><strong>Severity Level</strong></a></td><td>The higher the severity level, the higher the security risk of the issue. Each severity level adds a different Score to the issue. The Score can be, at most, 500 points. Currently, Snyk Code does not use the Critical severity level.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="breakdown-of-code-analysis.md#fix-analysis"><strong>Fix analysis</strong></a></td><td>When an issue has a real-world fix example, it is marked as easier to fix, with a higher Priority Score. The Score can be, at most, 200 points. When Fix analysis is available, it is displayed in the <strong>Full Details</strong> panel of the issue on the <strong>Fix analysis</strong> tab.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Issue occurrence in a Project</strong></td><td>The number of times a specific issue appears in the <strong>Code Analysis</strong> Project. The higher the frequency, the higher the risk and the Score. The Score can be, at most, 100 points.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Issue occurrence in a File</strong></td><td>The number of times an issue appears in a specific file. The higher the frequency, the higher the risk and the Score. The Score can be, at most, 100 points.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Community Projects</strong></td><td>The number of times an issue was fixed in external open-source Projects that Snyk examined. The Score can be, at most, 100 points.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../snyk-admin/introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-tags.md"><strong>Project tags</strong></a></td><td><p></p><p>When an issue has a Project tag, it decreases the Priority Score by 100 points. This internal tag can be one of the following:</p><ul><li>Test - The issue was found in a test file.</li><li>Beta - The vulnerability type of the issue is in Beta status.<br>These internal tags are automatically assigned by Snyk Code analysis, and they are not visible on the Web UI.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Quantitative factors

* Severity scores from other SAST products where information is publicly available
* Severity scores from identifying similar vulnerabilities in the Snyk Vulnerability database

### Qualitative factors

* The severity of source, direct versus indirect
* Prevalence and impact of the sink
* Security team experience and research
* Customer feedback

## Example: CWE-22: Path Traversal

For CWE-22 Path Traversal, if the vulnerability occurs in a test, it is Low severity. If not, and it comes from a direct source, it is High severity. Otherwise, it is Low severity.

# Fix code vulnerabilities automatically

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Release status**&#x20;

DeepCode AI Fix is in [Early Access](../../../getting-started/snyk-release-process.md#early-access) and available only for Enterprise plans.

To enable the feature, see [Enable DeepCode AI Fix Suggestions](fix-code-vulnerabilities-automatically.md#enable-deepcode-ai-fix).
{% endhint %}

Fix the security issues and quality flaws in the source code through an automated flow. DeepCode AI Fix Suggestions calculates the most suitable solution for your issues and applies it automatically.

## Why use DeepCode AI Fix?

DeepCode AI Fix combines the power of a thorough program analysis engine with the abilities of an in-house deep learning-based large language model. This combination allows for compiling large amounts of unstructured language information [from open-source code](fix-code-vulnerabilities-automatically.md#what-data-does-deepcode-ai-fix-suggestions-collect).

Key features set DeepCode AI Fix apart. It has a neural network trained on millions of lines of code, allowing for greater versatility and creativity. The [Snyk Code engine](../snyk-code-local-engine.md) rigorously checks the suggestions from the neural network, ensuring all automated fixes are small and targeted to each vulnerability or code issue.

## What issues can you fix automatically?

You can address various issues detected by the Snyk Code engine in terms of quality, promoting best code practices, and security vulnerabilities. DeepCode AI Fix currently does not support inter-file fixes.&#x20;

## DeepCode AI Fix language support

DeepCode AI Fix supports the following languages:

* Javascript and Typescript
* Java
* Python
* C/C++
* Go (Limited support)
* C# (Limited support)
* APEX (Limited support)

What is the difference between supported and limited support?&#x20;

* Supported languages provide remediation for 10 or more rules covering the OWASP Top 10,&#x20;
* Limited support languages provide remediation for less than 10 rules.

## How DeepCode AI Fix works

A representation of information flow involved in fixing one issue is presented in the following table.

## Requirements for DeepCode AI Fix

* [Snyk Code Enterprise plan](../../../implement-snyk/enterprise-implementation-guide/trial-limitations.md).
* Snyk IDE Plugin for  [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner-preview) or [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/snyk-security-code%E2%80%8B-open-source%E2%80%8B-iac-configurations).

## Enable DeepCode AI Fix

Enable DeepCode AI Fix  for your Organization in Snyk Web UI by navigating to **Settings** > **Snyk Preview**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/enable_fix_suggestions_snyk_preview.png" alt="DeepCodeAI Fix Suggestions settings in Snyk Preview"><figcaption><p>DeepCodeAI Fix Suggestions settings in Snyk Preview</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Prerequisites for enabling DeepCode AI Fix**

* Save the file before fixing an issue, as it requires clean code (saved code) to provide a fix.
* Snyk recommends that when you save the code, you re-run the analysis to show code actions, such as **Fix this issue**.
* You can request a fix by clicking **Fix this issue** in Code Lense and then saving the file. If your plugin settings are set to test automatically when saving, it will trigger the Snyk Code Analysis, and as a result, the issue disappears.

## Example: Fix code issue automatically

Consider the following scenario where hardcoded credentials are fixed using DeepCode AI Fix Suggestions.

Snyk highlights hardcoded credentials as a vulnerability by adding a **Fix this issue** element in the IDE.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/fix_suggestions_discovery (1).png" alt="Discovering a vulnerability in the code"><figcaption><p>Discovering a vulnerability in the code</p></figcaption></figure>

The issue is fixed by replacing the credentials with environment variables.

## What data does DeepCode AI Fix collect?

The Large Language Model (LLM) is trained exclusively on public repositories with permissive licenses. If a license for a repository changes after the initial scrape, the repository is immediately excluded from the training data. During the inference, DeepCode AI Fix does not collect or send the client data to third parties.

The data collection process is thorough and includes the following:

* Static analysis
* Automated assessment of the suggested fix qualities
* Partial in-house labeling by humans

The training data is ensured to be of the highest quality to optimize the performance of the LLM.

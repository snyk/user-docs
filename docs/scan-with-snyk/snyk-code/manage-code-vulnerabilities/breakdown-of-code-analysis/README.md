# Breakdown of code analysis

The **Code Analysis** page displays the results of the Snyk Code test for a specific repository. These results are all the vulnerability issues that Snyk Code discovered in the source code of the imported repository:

The **Code Analysis** page consists of several areas:

* [Header](project-summary.md) - includes the details of the imported repository with a link to the repository in the SCM, the Project name, and the Projects tabs: **Overview**, **History**, and **Settings**.
* [The Project Summary Information area](broken-reference) - includes the dates of the repository import and the last test of the repository, the **Retest now** option for a manual test, the name of the user who imported the repository, the name of the Project owner, and the number of code files that were analyzed and not analyzed.
* [The filter pane](broken-reference) - includes a set of pre-defined criteria for filtering the displayed issues.
* [The vulnerability issues area](vulnerabilities.md) - includes the vulnerability issues that Snyk Code discovered in the imported repository.
* [**Data flow** page](broken-reference) - displays the taint flow of the issue in the code.
* [**Fix analysis** page](fix-analysis.md) - provides additional details about the discovered vulnerability type, best practices for preventing this issue, and code examples of fixes.

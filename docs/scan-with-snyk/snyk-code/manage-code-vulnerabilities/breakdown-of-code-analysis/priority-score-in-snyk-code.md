# Priority Score in Snyk Code

Snyk Code assigns a Priority Score to each discovered issue displayed on the Web UI. This Priority Score can help filter and prioritize the issues discovered in your source code according to their level of importance, risk, frequency, and ease of fix:

## **Priority Score factors**

A Priority Score for each issue can be between 0-1000, and it changes automatically if one of its factors changes. For example, if the Severity Level of an issue has increased or decreased, the Priority Score of the issue changes accordingly.

Calculation of the Priority Score is based on the following factors:

* **Severity Level**: the higher the severity level, the higher the security risk of the issue. Therefore, each severity level adds a different Score to the issue. The Score can be, at most, 500 points.\
  Note that Snyk Code currently does not use the **Critical** severity level.
* **Availability of a Fix Example for the issue**: when an issue has a Fix Example, it is easier to fix and, therefore, has a higher Priority Score. The Score can be, at most, 200 points.\
  Note that when a Fix Example is available, it is displayed in the **Full Details** pane of the issue on the **Fix analysis** tab.
* **Issue occurrence in a Project**: the number of times a specific issue appears in the **Code Analysis** Project. The higher the number of times the issue appears, the higher the risk and, therefore, the Score. The Score can be, at most, 100 points.
* **Issue occurrence in a File:** the number of times an issue appears in a specific file. The higher the number of times the issue appears, the higher the risk and the Score. The Score can be, at most, 100 points.
* **Community Projects** â€“ the number of times an issue was fixed in external open-source projects that were examined by Snyk. The Score can be, at most, 100 points.
* **Internal tags:** when an issue has an internal tag, this tag decreases the Priority Score by 100 points. This internal tag can be one of the following:
  * Test - the issue was found in a test file.
  * Beta - the vulnerability type of the issue is in Beta status.\
    These internal tags are automatically assigned by Snyk Code analysis, and they are not visible on the Web UI.

## Filter vulnerabilities by Priority Score

You can filter the discovered issues according to their Priority Score, thus displaying only the issues that are between a certain Priority Score range.

To filter issues according to their Priority Score, on the **Code Analysis** page in the **Filter** pane, locate the **PRIORITY SCORE** slider.

Then, drag one or two of the handles to set the range of the Priority Score that you want to display.

The issue display changes automatically according to your selection, and only issues that have a Priority Score in the selected range are displayed.

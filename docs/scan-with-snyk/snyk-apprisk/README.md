# Snyk AppRisk

Snyk AppRisk is a product that enables Application Security teams to implement, manage, and scale a modern, high-performing, developer security program. The product covers use cases under Application Security Posture Management (ASPM).

**Snyk AppRisk Essentials** helps AppSec teams better operationalize and scale usage of Snyk with broad application visibility and security coverage management. At the same time, **Snyk AppRisk Pro** enhances the foundational capabilities of Snyk AppRisk Essentials by supporting non-Snyk Application Security products, offering a more extensive and flexible ASPM approach. It enables integrations with a wider range of security tools beyond the Snyk ecosystem, advanced security policies, in-depth risk analysis, and more customizable controls. This allows security teams to manage and maintain a robust security framework across diverse applications and development environments, ensuring a heightened level of protection and compliance.&#x20;

Snyk AppRisk Essentials enables:&#x20;

* **Automated app asset discovery**: Continually discover application assets and classify them by business context, ensuring security is in sync with development.
* **Tailored security controls**: Define and manage appropriate security and compliance requirements, and verify the correct controls are in place.
* **Risk-based prioritization**: Assess risk for each app based on application context and best-in-class security analysis and fix guidance to focus developer remediation efforts on issues that matter most to the business.

Snyk AppRisk Pro builds upon the capabilities of Snyk AppRisk Essentials by offering:

* **More sophisticated risk-based prioritization** with runtime Insights - such as whether an app is deployed and public facing, and whether vulnerable packages found by Snyk Open Source are actually used in runtime.
* **Manage security coverage for secrets detection tools**: Assess coverage for secrets detection alongside Snyk's AST products.
* **Scalability for diverse environments**: Robust security management across various development environments.

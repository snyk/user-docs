## General troubleshooting for PR Checks

The following table lists general issues with PR Checks and how to address them.

| Scenario                                                              | Description                                                                                                       | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| PR Check not triggered.                                               | The repository is imported to Snyk, but when a PR is raised it does not trigger a PR Check.                       | <ol><li>Check the <a href="configure-pr-checks.md">Project and Integration settings</a> to make sure PR checks are configured. </li><li>Check the Project Settings integration page for a banner advising you that a webhook is <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">absent</a>. <br><br>Double-check integration permission scopes (see <a href="../../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/">Git repositories</a>). <br><br>If you still cannot create a webhook, <a href="https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact support</a>.</li></ol> |
| PR Check is expected but does not run.                                | The PR check is listed in the Git repository (SCM) as expected but never completes.                               | <p>This issue is generally caused by a Branch Protection rule requiring the PR check. If the Project has been disabled or removed from Snyk, the PR check will not run, but the branch protection rule is still in force until removed or edited. <br><br>Check for Branch Protection rules and confirm that the Project is imported and active. </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Multiple Security and Licence PR Checks run on a single Pull Request. | When a PR is submitted, multiple Snyk PR Checks of the same type run against it, possibly with different results. | <p>If a repository is imported into multiple Snyk Organizations, PR checks will run on the repository for any configured Organization.<br><br>Check the name of the PR check as it includes the Organization name against which the check is run.

## Open-source and licensing checks

If you come across false positive or false negative results, you can take action to diagnose and report the issue.&#x20;

## What to do if there are errors

### Re-run PR Checks results

To re-run PR Checks results:

* Create an empty commit for example with `git commit â€“allow-empty`&#x20;
* Create a new commit with a fix or additional capability
* Close and re-open the pull request in your connected Git repository (for example, GitHub).

### Mark as successful

Provide specific users or roles with the capability to pass the PR Check when errors happen. This can be done through the Snyk link in the PR Check and Marking as successful.&#x20;

# Custom Base Images
### [SNYK-CBI-0001](#snyk-cbi-0001)

#### Versioning schema does not support tag

The versioning schema used does not support the given tag. Update the versioning schema to include the tag.

Once the tag of the custom base image is correct, the versioning schema must be modified.
You can use a different versioning schema that supports all tags in the repository or you can update the relevant properties of the versioning schema.

For example, if the repository currently uses Semver, and a new tag "1.2.5.7" needs to be added, then you can use a Custom versioning schema.

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0004](#snyk-os-dotnet-0004)

#### The dotnet CLI is unable to generate a self-contained binary

This error occurs when running `dotnet publish --sc --framework <your-target-framework>` fails to generate a 
self-contained binary. Snyk needs to run this command in order to adequately determine the dependency tree for your project. If this command fails, Snyk cannot continue.

Steps to determine why this happened:

* Checkout a clean version of your project in a temporary folder
* Run `dotnet publish --sc --framework <your-target-framework> ` on your project, and confirm this step fails.

If this step is successful locally, it is possible that Snyk is running another version of the .NET SDK. To tell Snyk which version of the .NET SDK to use, consider using the [global.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) solution provided by Microsoft.

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0005](#snyk-os-dotnet-0005)

#### The dotnet CLI was unable to restore from private package sources

This error occurs when running `dotnet restore` fails to access dependencies stored in a private package source that Snyk does not have access to. 

This means that your `.csproj` file or files refer to a dependency hosted on a private package store or Nuget Artifact Registry defined in your `NuGet.config` file, such as:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="AzureFeed" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/your-org/_packaging/your-repo/nuget/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

In order to allow Snyk to access your private dependency package source, you must supply Snyk with a valid JSON object as a private registry token in the .NET language settings.

You can set up a connection to your private Nuget repository in your Snyk integration settings.

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0006](#snyk-os-dotnet-0006)

#### Missing MSBuild Condition Construct in project file

The `dotnet` tool was unable to locate the `.targets`, `.csproj` or `.props` file responsible for one or more MSBuild conditions in your project file.

The tool encountered an error like 
```
/path/to/file/project.csproj(33,13): error MSB4100: Expected "$(SomeCondition)" to evaluate to a boolean instead of "", in condition "!$(SomeCondition)".
```

This means the condition definition is missing in the project file that is currently being restored and in any project linked to it from there.      

Snyk can scan only the project files accessible in the current repository or the private dependencies available to Snyk.

For example, if your code has the following structure:

```title=project.targets
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <SomeCondition Condition="'$(SomeCondition)' == ''">false</SomeCondition>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

And

```title=project.csproj
<Project Sdk='Microsoft.NET.Sdk'>
  <Import Project='..\external-libraries\some-library\project.targets' />
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net8.0</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup Condition='!$(SomeCondition)'>
    <PackageReference Include='Newtonsoft.Json' Version='13.0.3' />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0008](#snyk-os-dotnet-0008)

#### Your global.json is targeting an outdated SDK version

Snyk supports the latest channels of .NET which is currently [supported by Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet), but does **not** guarantee to support all SDK versions within each currently supported channel.

Within the supported channels, Snyk aims to support most, if not all, of the SDK versions currently released under the **newest** of the channels.

If the channels currently supported by Microsoft are `8.0`, `7.0` and `6.0`, Snyk **will** support all of the *latest* SDKs released for these channels.

If the SDK versions released under `8.0.3` are: `8.0.203`, `8.0.202` and `8.0.103`, Snyk **cannot** guarantee to support *all* of them, but makes an effort to do so. Snyk **will** support the latest of the SDK versions currently released by Microsoft. 

If channel `8.0` is the newest channel currently supported, Snyk **cannot** guarantee that multiple, specific SDK versions for older, still supported channels such as .NET 6. 

### Example support matrix

If:

* .NET channels currently supported by Microsoft are `.NET 8.0`,  `.NET 7.0` and  `.NET 6.0`
* Newest SDK version under `.NET 8.0` is `8.0.203`

Then:

| Channel |              SDK             | End-of-Life |  Supported  |
|:-------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|   8.0   | 8.0.203  (latest in channel) |      No     |     Yes     |
|   8.0   |            8.0.202           |      No     |     Yes     |
|   8.0   |            8.0.103           |      No     |     Yes     |
|         |             (...)            |             |             |

|         |             (..)             |             |             |
|   5.0   |  5.0.408 (latest in channel) |     Yes     |      No     |
|   5.0   |            5.0.214           |     Yes     |      No     |
|         |             (..)             |             |             |

### Workarounds

This limitation can lead to scan failures for customers that are pinning SDK versions in their `global.json` files without a [rollForward](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json#rollforward) directive, such as:
```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "6.0.101"
  }
}
```
Since as `6.0` is not the newest .NET channel. 

To work around this issue, we recommend that customers employ some flexibility in their `global.json` file by employing the `rollFoward` directive to be `latestMajor`, as such:
```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "6.0.101",
    "rollForward": "latestMajor"
  }
}
```

Which will allow Snyk to scan your code using a newer version of the SDK, despite your version pinning.

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0009](#snyk-os-dotnet-0009)

#### Project failed to build due to missing type or namespace references

While attempting to build your solution for scanning, the `dotnet` SDK was unable to restore one or more projects referenced in your manifest files.

Please note that Snyk runs these builds on a **case-sensitive** filesystem, meaning that `<ProjectReference>../src/NS.Project.csproj</ProjectReference>` and `<ProjectReference>../src/ns.project.csproj</ProjectReference>` are not referring to the same thing.

This can present itself as a problem for customers that are using Mac or Windows build pipeline where file systems are not case-sensitive. In this case, verify you're referring to the right manifest files and check the Snyk import logs for more details.

#### Your project repository is missing required files

Generating the dependency graph requires Snyk to run go list `go list -deps -json` inside the project. If the operation fails, creating a full dependency graph cannot continue.  

This error means that you need some cleanup, (such as `go mod tidy`) or your project deployment process contains a code generation step such as `protobuf` or similar that is not currently supported by Snyk. 

To verify if this is the case, clone your project in a clean environment, run go list `go list -deps -json` and verify whether the operation fails. 

If Snyk cannot process your code successfully, insert the Snyk CLI as part of your deployment pipeline.

Generating the dependency graph requires Snyk to run `go list -deps -json` inside the project. If the operation fails, creating a full dependency graph cannot continue.  

This error means that there is inconsistency between your `vendor/modules.txt` file and your `go.mod` file. To remediate, you need to:

* `go mod vendor`
* `go mod tidy`

Next, commit those changes to your repo. Snyk does not manipulate with your code on our end by design, which is why this is not done automatically.

To verify if this is the case, clone your project in a clean environment, run go list `go list -deps -json` and verify whether the operation fails. 
Then try and run the above mentioned commands and see if your SCM system reports changes in files.

#### Missing module declaration in go.mod

The Go toolchain encountered an error while reading the go.mod file. The error indicates that the module declaration is missing.

This error typically occurs when the go.mod file does not specify the module path. To resolve this issue, you need to add a module declaration to the go.mod file.

To specify the module path, run the following command: go mod edit -module=example.com/mod

Update the go.mod file with the correct module path and try again.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0019](#snyk-os-go-0019)

#### Go module version constraint not met

The Go toolchain encountered a version constraint violation while resolving dependencies.

This error typically occurs when a module or dependency specifies a version requirement that is not satisfied by the current Go version in use. For example, a module may require "go >= 1.22.0", but your environment is running "go 1.21.0".

To resolve this, ensure your Go toolchain version meets the module's specified constraint. This might involve upgrading or downgrading your Go version from Settings -> Snyk Open Source -> Edit settings for Go, or finding an alternative version of the module that is compatible with your current Go environment.

# PRChecks
### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0001](#snyk-pr-check-0001)

#### Error reading manifest

Snyk failed to read 1 or more manifest files.
Sometimes things go wrong: a flaky connection, 3rd party services go down and Snyk is unable to read the files needed in order to test your project. 

If this happens, you could try:

- Opening and re-opening your Pull Request / Merge Request, to kick off a new test
- Removing and re-adding the repo to Snyk

Ultimately, you should contact support@snyk.io if the issue persists

### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0002](#snyk-pr-check-0002)

#### Manifest not found

Snyk uses your project manifest file to analyze your projects for vulnerabilities. When you import a project for monitoring, Snyk scans the project to locate the manifest file and then remembers where that file is. 
When a project manifest file is moved or deleted, we still try to look for in it in the last known location in order to run tests on commit statuses. If we can't find the file, this error can occur.

If this happens, you could try the following:
1. Delete the matching project from your account in the Snyk app (UI or CLI).
2. Now import the same project from scratch.

As during the original import, Snyk scans the project and locates the manifest file.

#### Rate limit hit while testing project

Snyk makes requests to your SCM when testing a project, in order to analyze your projects for vulnerabilities. If we need to make a lot of requests in a short time period, we may encounter third party rate limits, and this error can occur.

If you receive any of these errors, try re-running the tests, by closing and reopening the pull request.

### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0004](#snyk-pr-check-0004)

#### Out of Sync Error

Sometimes a project may become out of sync between the lockfile and the manifest file. This might happen if the package.json is modified or updated but the lockfile is not. 

This can be resolved by ensuring the lockfile and manifest file are correctly synced, by executing npm install or yarn install.

In some cases, it may be necessary to delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json and run npm install again to force a full reinstall.

### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0008](#snyk-pr-check-0008)

#### Merge conflict error

Merge Conflict Error is not a Snyk specific issue but rather some issues on your SCM environment. As an example, merge conflicts could happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

To resolve this, you might need to figure out all the merge conflicts on your SCM environment and resolve them to fully remediate these types of errors on Snyk. As a note, this cannot be modified/changed on Snyk's side.

# Snyk Error Codes

The error codes in the table below describe the codes that you may encounter while working with the [Snyk API](../snyk-api-info/README.md) or [CLI](../snyk-cli/README.md). When errors are encountered using the API, they will also have an appropriate [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). If you encounter errors without an error code, use the HTTP status code to determine the appropriate action.

It also occurs if the entry point function, `Main`, is defined with the wrong case, such as lower-case main.

In order to fix this issue, ensure that your program has a .cs file that contains a main function, such as
```c#
namespace Example
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0004](#snyk-os-dotnet-0004)

#### The dotnet CLI is unable to generate a self-contained binary

This error occurs when running `dotnet publish --sc --framework <your-target-framework>` fails to generate a 
self-contained binary. Snyk needs to run this command in order to adequately determine the dependency tree for your project. If this command fails, Snyk cannot continue.

Steps to determine why this happened:

* Checkout a clean version of your project in a temporary folder
* Run `dotnet publish --sc --framework <your-target-framework> ` on your project, and confirm this step fails.

If this step is successful locally, it is possible that Snyk is running another version of the .NET SDK. To tell Snyk which version of the .NET SDK to use, consider using the [global.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) solution provided by Microsoft.

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0006](#snyk-os-dotnet-0006)

#### Missing MSBuild Condition Construct in project file

The `dotnet` tool was unable to locate the `.targets`, `.csproj` or `.props` file responsible for one or more MSBuild conditions in your project file.

The tool encountered an error like 
```
/path/to/file/project.csproj(33,13): error MSB4100: Expected "$(SomeCondition)" to evaluate to a boolean instead of "", in condition "!$(SomeCondition)".
```

This means the condition definition is missing in the project file that is currently being restored and in any project linked to it from there.      

Snyk can scan only the project files accessible in the current repository or the private dependencies available to Snyk.

For example, if your code has the following structure:

```title=project.targets
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <SomeCondition Condition="'$(SomeCondition)' == ''">false</SomeCondition>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

And

```title=project.csproj
<Project Sdk='Microsoft.NET.Sdk'>
  <Import Project='..\external-libraries\some-library\project.targets' />
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net8.0</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup Condition='!$(SomeCondition)'>
    <PackageReference Include='Newtonsoft.Json' Version='13.0.3' />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

And `external-libraries` is not a part of your repository currently being scanned, Snyk is not able to find it.

This error occurs when your code depends on external libraries that are added to or generated from your source code using external tools unknown to Snyk or as part of a build step in your build or a deployment pipeline.

### [SNYK-OS-DOTNET-0007](#snyk-os-dotnet-0007)

#### No target frameworks found in manifest files

Snyk was unable to detect any `<TargetFramework>`s in the supplied manifest files. 

If you are using `Directory.Build.props` files to determine the target framework, ensure that it is named as such. Due to performance considerations on the customer's SCM network, Snyk does not perform case-insensitive searches for `.props` files.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0003](#snyk-os-go-0003)

#### OAuth re-authorization required

Your code is cloned on an isolated environment using Git as it is required by Snyk to analyze its dependencies.

Your Organization has enabled or enforced SAML SSO after you authorized Snyk to access your code, and a re-authentication is therefore required.

The error you're seeing is usually reproducible by attempting to do a `git clone` of your repository with incorrectly configured credentials.
Verify your authentication configuration with your Git cloud provider and try again.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0004](#snyk-os-go-0004)

#### Your project repository is missing required files

Generating the dependency graph requires Snyk to run go list `go list -deps -json` inside the project. If the operation fails, creating a full dependency graph cannot continue.  

This error means that you need some cleanup, such as `go mod tidy`) or your project deployment process contains a code generation step such as `protobuf` or similar that is not currently supported by Snyk. 

To verify if this is the case, clone your project in a clean environment, run go list `go list -deps -json` and verify whether the operation fails. 

If Snyk cannot process your code successfully, insert the Snyk CLI as part of your deployment pipeline.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0005](#snyk-os-go-0005)

#### Your project repository has inconsistent vendoring information

Generating the dependency graph requires Snyk to run `go list -deps -json` inside the project. If the operation fails, creating a full dependency graph cannot continue.  

This error means that there is inconsistency between your `vendor/modules.txt` file and your `go.mod` file. To remediate, you need to:

* `go mod vendor`
* `go mod tidy`

Next, commit those changes to your repo. Snyk does not manipulate with your code on our end by design, which is why this is not done automatically.

To verify if this is the case, clone your project in a clean environment, run go list `go list -deps -json` and verify whether the operation fails. 
Then try and run the above mentioned commands and see if your SCM system reports changes in files.

#### Unsupported external file generation

Snyk currently does not support external file generation in your project. This limitation is due to Snyk's lack of visibility into the third-party generator tools you may be using and the specific commands required to generate these files.

Snyk can only work with the files available in your repository and does not have insight into the generation process for external files.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0007](#snyk-os-go-0007)

#### Unable to access private dependencies

The Go tool encountered a `DepsError` while trying to download a private dependency. Private repositories that are not accessible to the public internet and are not available on the official Go proxy mirror are cloned with a version control system and built on demand. 
This requires the VCS to have the correct access rights to that repository.

Snyk supports private repositories that are hosted in the same Organization and on the same Project that is scanned for vulnerabilities. The authentication to the private repository is the same as the authentication used to integrate that repository with Snyk. 

This error appears when the authorization credentials do not allow access to the requested private dependency.

### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0002](#snyk-pr-check-0002)

#### Manifest not found

Snyk uses your project manifest file to analyze your projects for vulnerabilities. When you import a project for monitoring, Snyk scans the project to locate the manifest file and then remembers where that file is. 
When a project manifest file is moved or deleted, we still try to look for in it in the last known location in order to run tests on commit statuses. If we can't find the file, this error can occur.

If this happens, you could try the following:
1. Delete the matching project from your account in the Snyk app (UI or CLI).
2. Now import the same project from scratch.

As during the original import, Snyk scans the project and locates the manifest file.

### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0003](#snyk-pr-check-0003)

#### Rate limit hit while testing project

Snyk makes requests to your SCM when testing a project, in order to analyze your projects for vulnerabilities. If we need to make a lot of requests in a short time period, we may encounter third party rate limits, and this error can occur.

If you receive any of these errors, try re-running the tests, by closing and reopening the pull request.

**HTTP Status:** [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429)


### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0004](#snyk-pr-check-0004)

#### Out of Sync Error

Sometimes a project may become out of sync between the lockfile and the manifest file. This might happen if the package.json is modified or updated but the lockfile is not. 

This can be resolved by ensuring the lockfile and manifest file are correctly synced, by executing npm install or yarn install.

In some cases, it may be necessary to delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json and run npm install again to force a full reinstall.

### [SNYK-PR-CHECK-0008](#snyk-pr-check-0008)

#### Merge conflict error

Merge Conflict Error is not a Snyk specific issue but rather some issues on your SCM environment. As an example, merge conflicts could happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

To resolve this, you might need to figure out all the merge conflicts on your SCM environment and resolve them to fully remediate these types of errors on Snyk. As a note, this cannot be modified/changed on Snyk's side.

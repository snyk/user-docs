# Create and modify policies

The Policy Manager allows you to [create](create-and-edit-policies.md#create-a-policy), [edit](create-and-edit-policies.md#edit-a-policy), and [duplicate or delete a policy](create-and-edit-policies.md#duplicate-or-delete-a-policy).

## **Create a policy**

1. On the Policy Manager screen, select **Add new policy** and in response to the prompts, enter the details.
2. Enter a policy name and a description to help you quickly identify a policy.\
   Policies in the same category cannot have the same name. You cannot save a policy without a name.
3. Select whether to apply the policy to Organizations or Project attributes.
4. Select the [Organizations](assign-a-policy-to-an-organization.md) or [attributes](assign-policies-to-projects.md) to which you want to apply the policy.
5. Add rules to the policy. See [Create a license policy and rules](license-policies/create-a-license-policy-and-rules.md) or [Create a security policy and rules](security-policies/create-a-security-policy-and-rules.md).
6. Click **Submit** to create and save the policy.

### Delete a policy

{% hint style="info" %}
Deleting a policy cannot be undone. If you delete a policy that has Organizations assigned to it, those Organizations will return to the default policy.
{% endhint %}

### Duplicate a policy

Duplicating a policy copies the rules of a policy but not the assigned Organizations or Projects. The new policy is automatically called **Copy of (Policy Name)â€¦** and can be edited as [explained in Edit a policy](create-and-edit-policies.md#edit-a-policy).

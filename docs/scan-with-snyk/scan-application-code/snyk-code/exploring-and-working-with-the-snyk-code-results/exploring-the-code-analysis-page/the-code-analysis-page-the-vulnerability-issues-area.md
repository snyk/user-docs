# The Code Analysis page - the Vulnerability Issues area

The Vulnerability Issues area on the **Code Analysis** page displays all the issues that were discovered in the imported repository by Snyk Code. This issue list is organized by the severity level of the discovered issues, by default from the highest to the lowest:

You can change the display of the issues in the **Code Analysis** page using the following option:

* \*\*\*\*[**Grouping**](the-code-analysis-page-the-vulnerability-issues-area.md#grouping-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-file-or-vulnerability-type) - by **File** or **Vulnerability Type**.
* \*\*\*\*[**Sorting**](the-code-analysis-page-the-vulnerability-issues-area.md#sorting-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-severity-level) - from the **Highest** or the **Lowest** severity level.
* \*\*\*\*[**Filtering**](the-code-analysis-page-the-vulnerability-issues-area.md#sorting-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-severity-level) - according to pre-defined criteria or a search word.

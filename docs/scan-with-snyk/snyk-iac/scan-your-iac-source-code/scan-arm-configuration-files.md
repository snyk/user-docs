# Scan ARM configuration files

Snyk IaC currently supports scanning ARM configurations with the CLI only.

For the CLI, users can share their ARM scan results with the platform and present them in the UI by using the [Share CLI results feature](../../../developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/share-cli-results-with-the-snyk-web-ui.md).

For more information, see [Test your ARM files with the CLI tool](../../../developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/test-your-iac-files/arm-files.md).

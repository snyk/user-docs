# Jira integration for Snyk IaC

Snyk Infrastructure as Code allows users to raise Jira issues for misconfigurations found in their IaC resources.

This integration is available via the Snyk Web UI only; API support is not provided.

To learn more about setting up and using the integration, see [Jira integration](../../../integrations/jira-and-slack-integrations/jira-integration.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The links to any created Jira tickets do not appear next to the misconfiguration issues shown in Snyk Reporting.

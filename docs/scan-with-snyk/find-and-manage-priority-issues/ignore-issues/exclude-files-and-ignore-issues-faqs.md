# Exclude files and ignore issues FAQs

There are many considerations in determining how excluding files and ignoring issues will work, depending on several factors:

* How the Project was imported: through an SCM integration, or through the CLI or an IDE
* The scanning method being used: Open Source, Code, Container, Current IaC, IaC+
* How the test is being done, in the UI, or through the CLI or an IDE
* How the exclude or ignore was set: in a policy, through the UI or the API, or in the `.snyk` file

This document collects questions the support team receives frequenty and provides the answers.

## Questions related to scanning methods

### Q: How do I ignore issues and vulnerabilities in Code (SAST) scans?

* To ignore a code vulnerability, import the Project into the Snyk UI, and use the ignore button.&#x20;
* You cannot use the `.snyk` file to ignore issues in Code scans.
* If you use the Early Access CLI option `code test --report`, issues ignored in the Web UI are suppressed in linked CLI scans. See [Ignore CLI results](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code/publish-snyk-code-cli-results-and-ignore-issues.md#ignore-cli-results) when publishing Snyk Code results.
* This is not currently shown in the results from the `snyk-to-html` tool for code scans with ignored issues; these will still show as issues.

### Q: How do I avoid scanning certain files for Open Source scans?

* Use the --`exclude` option when scanning with the CLI to omit scanning directories or files but not paths. This option excludes all directories or all files with specified names. For details, see [the --exclude option](../../../snyk-cli/commands/test.md#exclude-less-than-name-greater-than-less-than-name-greater-than-...greater-than) in the CLI test command help.
*   If you import a Project through an SCM integration, add the exclusions, folders only, to the bottom of the import window; see [Stage 2: Import Project](../../../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/snyk-scm-integration-good-practices.md#stage-2-import-projects) in Git repositories deployment recommendations.\

* You can use exclusion globs in api import, including the `snyk-api-import` tool. This exclusion works the same way as an SCM integration exclusion. These work for Code and Container scans only.
* You cannot use the `--exclude` option in a `.snyk` file for Open Source scans except for unmanaged scans. For details, see [Ignore files or folders using glob expression - Snyk Code and `unmanaged`only](../../../snyk-cli/commands/ignore.md#ignore-files-or-folders-using-glob-expression-snyk-code-and-unmanaged-only).

### Q: How do I avoid scanning certain files for Code scans?

* Use the `--exclude` option in a `.snyk` file to omit all scanning of certain files or folders. For details, see [Ignore files or folders using glob expression - Snyk Code and `unmanaged`only](../../../snyk-cli/commands/ignore.md#ignore-files-or-folders-using-glob-expression-snyk-code-and-unmanaged-only).
* Use the `snyk ignore --file-path` command to omit scanning of certain files or folders in Snyk Code scan. For details, see [Exclude directories and files from Snyk Code CLI tests](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code/exclude-directories-and-files-from-snyk-code-cli-tests.md).
* When you import a repository to test using Snyk Code, use an `exclude:` statement in the `.snyk` file to omit certain directories and files from the import. For details see For details see [Exclude directories and files from Snyk Code CLI tests](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code/exclude-directories-and-files-from-snyk-code-cli-tests.md).
* A `.snyk` file with file or folder exclusions and contained in the root directory of your repository or SCM will exclude those files and folders from being scanned when you import using an SCM.
* The CLI `--exclude` option used with `snyk test` and `snyk monitor` does not work for Code scans.
* The import window Exclude Folders option does not work for Code scans.
* The `.snyk` file does not work for excluding files and directories from IDE scanning of Code.

### Q: How do I avoid scanning certain files for Container Scans?

See the [`--exclude-app-vulns`](../../../snyk-cli/commands/container-test.md#exclude-app-vulns) and the [`--exclude-base-image-vulns`](../../../snyk-cli/commands/container-test.md#exclude-base-image-vulns) options in the `snyk container test` help.

### Q: How do I avoid scanning certain files for IaC scans?

See [IaC exclusions using the command line](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/iac-exclusions-using-the-command-line.md).

## Question related to ways excludes and ignores are set

### Q: Why do ignores in snyk file in the root directory of my monorepo apply to all Projects when I scan with CLI but do not work when I import using my SCM?

For SCM scanning, the `.snyk` file must be present in each relevant subdirectory. See [Monorepos and complex Project considerations](../../policies/the-.snyk-file.md#monorepos-and-complex-project-considerations) with the `.snyk` file.\

# Import Project repository

## How importing repositories works

After you select repositories on the Snyk Web UI and click the **Add selected repositories** button, the import starts, and a progress bar appears on the **Projects** page.

Once the import is complete, a confirmation message will appear on the Projects page. Your imported repositories will be listed as separate Target folders, each named after your Git repository account and the imported repository. Inside each folder, you'll find the Snyk Projects created for that repository.

If some of the files in the selected repositories were not imported, you receive a notification about the Projects that were not imported.&#x20;

Keeping dependencies up-to-date is crucial for security, performance, and compatibility. Snyk simplifies the process by scanning Projects for outdated dependencies and proposing updates through automated pull requests. This method allows teams to:

* Review and merge changes in a controlled, systematic manner.
* Keep your ecosystem and Projects updated with the latest versions of packages.
* Automate testing to ensure new updates do not break existing functionality.

If you use Snyk to update your open source and private dependencies, you can keep your projects up to date with minimal manual intervention, reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities, and improve the overall quality of the software. More than that, you'll always be aware of newer versions for the packages you use and make progressive effort to use the latest ones, in advance to when such upgrades become a non negotiable.

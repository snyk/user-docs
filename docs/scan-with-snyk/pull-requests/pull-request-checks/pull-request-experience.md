# Pull Request Experience

The Snyk Pull Request Experience reduces context switching by displaying additional information about the PR Check scan results in the pull request.

The following features are part of the Pull Request Experience:

* [Issue Summary Comment](pull-request-experience.md#issue-summary-comment)
* [Inline Comments](pull-request-experience.md#inline-comments)

## Prerequisites for the Snyk Pull Request Experience

* Snyk PR Checks must be enabled. For more information, see [Configure Pull Request Checks](configure-pull-request-checks.md).
* For the GitHub integration, a fixed GitHub account needs to be set to provide a consistent consistent comment experience. See [Opening fix and upgrade pull requests from a fixed GitHub account](../snyk-pull-or-merge-requests/opening-fix-and-upgrade-pull-requests-from-a-fixed-github-account.md) for more information.
* For inline comments, the **Code analysis PR checks** setting needs to be enabled at the [integration level](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks/pull-request-experience#configure-pull-request-experience-at-the-integration-level). In the Snyk Web UI, under **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Edit settings**,  verify that the option is enabled under **Pull request status checks** > **Code analysis**. If "Code analysis" is not visible, please reach out to your Snyk account team to enable Snyk Code for your account. If it is already enabled, check under **Settings** > **Snyk Code** to ensure it is turned on.

**Release status**

Inline Comments for Snyk PR Checks is in [Early Access](../../../getting-started/snyk-release-process.md#early-access) and available only for Snyk Code PR Checks.
{% endhint %}

The Inline Comments feature adds a detailed comment for each issue identified by the Snyk Code Pull Request Check. Each comment includes the severity level, the name and a short description of the issue, helpful links for further information, and, if applicable, the data flow.&#x20;

This feature is limited to 10 inline comments at Pull Request level. The Summary Comment will display a message if the cap is surpassed.

## Configure Pull Request Experience

You can configure the Pull Request Experience [at the Integration level](pull-request-experience.md#configure-pr-checks-at-the-integration-level) for your Snyk Organization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Pull Request Experience is set up individually for each integration. If you have multiple integrations, you need to configure the Pull Request Experience separately for each one.
{% endhint %}

### Configure Pull Request Experience at the Integration level

Configure the Pull Request Experience for one or more integrations in your Snyk Organization, for which [PR Checks](configure-pull-request-checks.md#configure-pr-checks-at-the-integration-level) are also enabled.

1. In the Snyk Organization you wish to activate and configure the Pull Request Experience for, navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** and select **Edit settings** your connected source code manager to open the settings configuration.
2. Configure and save the following changes:
   1. **Enable issue summary comment:** Enable this option to create an Issue Summary Comment on each pull request, which aggregates the PR Check results. If it is disabled, the entire Pull Request Experience is disabled.
   2. **Create comments for success cases:** By default, an Issue Summary Comment is created even if no vulnerabilities are detected by the PR Check. Disable this option to stop creating Issue Summary Comments for non-failing PR Checks.
   3. **Enable inline comments:** Enable inline comments to add a comment for each issue found by Snyk Code PR Check.

For the GitHub integration, configure opening fix and upgrade pull requests from a fixed GitHub account, by providing a Personal Access Token (PAT), which has `write` permissions or above to the repos monitored by Snyk. See[  ](../snyk-pull-or-merge-requests/opening-fix-and-upgrade-pull-requests-from-a-fixed-github-account.md)[Opening fix and upgrade pull requests from a fixed GitHub account](../snyk-pull-or-merge-requests/opening-fix-and-upgrade-pull-requests-from-a-fixed-github-account.md) for more information.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How can false positives be handled?

If a finding is a false positive, the comment can be manually resolved in the SCM. It will remain resolved even if the issue is detected again in a subsequent PR check.

### When a new commit is pushed, what is the behavior of the comments?

#### Issue Summary Comment

When a new commit is pushed to the pull request, the existing summary comment is updated with the latest Snyk scan results for that commit. This means the issues count is refreshed to reflect the most recent analysis. No new comments are added, ensuring developers get a concise view of potential vulnerabilities without being flooded with notifications.

#### Inline Comments

For every pushed commit, a review is created if Snyk Code PR Check detects new issues. Each issue is added as an inline comment. If an issue from a previous commit is fixed in the new commit, its comment is marked as resolved. Unresolved issues remain as inline comments.

### Why are PR comments not appearing in my repository?

To ensure your repository receives PR comments, please review the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites-for-the-snyk-pull-request-experience) for the Snyk Pull Request Experience. Make sure all required conditions are met and properly fulfilled.

### Why are inline comments not appearing in my repository?

Inline comments are available only for issues detected by Snyk Code PR Checks. To ensure that issues appear as inline comments, verify the following requirements:

1. **Snyk Code** is enabled for your organization.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/enable_snyk_code.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Configuration details to enable Snyk Code</p></figcaption></figure>
2. **Code Analysis** under the **Pull request status checks** section is enabled for your integration.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/enable_code_analysis.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Configuration details to enable Code Analysis</p></figcaption></figure>
3. **Inline Comments** under In the **Pull Request Experience** section is enabled for you integration.
<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-27 at 11.44.50.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Configuration details to enable Inline Comments</p></figcaption></figure>

⚠️ **Note**: Inline comments are not available if you are using the **Snyk Local Code Engine**.

### Why are some findings not appearing as inline comments?

Inline comments are only available for issues detected by Snyk Code PR Checks. Their behavior may vary depending on the SCM platform. On most platforms, an inline comment is added for each issue found. However, on GitLab, inline comments are only added for issues found within the files that were modified in the pull request.

### Is Broker supported?

Yes. Brokered integrations are supported for both **Issue Summary Comment** and **Inline Comments**, with compatibility for both Legacy and Universal Broker. Note that broker version 4.194 or higher is required.

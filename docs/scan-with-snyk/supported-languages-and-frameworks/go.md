# Go

## Supported frameworks and package managers

{% hint style="warning" %}
You might encounter false positives or false negatives for partially supported frameworks and package managers.
{% endhint %}

### Code analysis

Snyk Code support for Go is limited.

### Open source and licensing

{% hint style="warning" %}
From January 1 2023 Snyk no longer supports govendor Projects. As a general security best practice, Snyk recommends using tools that are consistently maintained and up-to-date.

After Snyk no longer supports scanning of govendor Projects, a warning will be issued and no results will be received.
{% endhint %}

Snyk supports testing and monitoring of Go Projects with dependencies managed by [Go Modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod) and [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).

#### Open source policy

To manage licenses from your developer workflows through policy, see the following topics:

* [Defining a secure open source policy](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/open-source-policy/)
* [Use Snyk security policies to prioritize fixes more efficiently](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-security-policies/)

#### Open source license compliance

To check compliance for open source licenses, see [Getting Started with Snyk License Compliance Management](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/licenses/getting-started-snyk-licensing-compliance).

#### Open source supported features

After Snyk has built the dependencies tree, Snyk uses the [vulnerability database](https://snyk.io/vuln) to find vulnerabilities in any of the packages anywhere in the dependency tree.

To scan your dependencies, ensure you have first installed the relevant package manager, and that your Project contains the supported manifest files.

The way Snyk analyzes and builds the dependencies tree varies depending on the language and package manager of the Project, as well as the location of your Project.&#x20;

## Getting started with Snyk for Go across environments

### Snyk CLI&#x20;

#### Prerequisites

1. [Create a Snyk account](../../getting-started/quickstart/create-or-log-in-to-a-snyk-account.md).
2. [Install Snyk CLI and authenticate your machine](../../snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli.md#install-the-snyk-cli-and-authenticate-your-machine).
3. [Set the default Organization for all Snyk tests](broken-reference) (code analysis).
4. Ensure you have installed the relevant package manager before you begin using the Snyk CLI (open source).
5. Ensure you have included the relevant manifest files supported by Snyk before testing.

#### Code analysis

To start testing your code using Snyk Code open your repository in a terminal and run the following  command:

```javascript
snyk code test
```

To customize test options, run other commands, exclude directories and files, and explore the results in different formats, see the following:

* [Snyk CLI commands](../../snyk-cli/commands/#available-commands)
* [Exclude directories and files from the Snyk tests](../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code/exclude-directories-and-files-from-snyk-code-cli-tests.md)
* [Explore test results in a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal ](broken-reference)
* [Exporting the test results to a JSON or SARIF file](broken-reference)

#### Open source and licensing

{% hint style="info" %}
To scan your dependencies in the CLI, ensure you have installed the relevant package manager and that your Project contains the supported manifest files.
{% endhint %}

#### **Go Modules and Snyk CLI**

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk scans Go Modules Projects in the CLI at the package level rather than the module level, as Snyk has full access to your local source code.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Packages from the [Go standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std) are not supported or included in the dependency tree.&#x20;

Packages under `golang.org/x/` which are [part of the Go Project](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x) but outside the main Go tree are supported.
{% endhint %}

To build the dependency tree, Snyk uses the `go list -json -deps ./...` command, and the dependencies found in `Imports` .

`TestImports` and `XTestImports` are not supported.

When you test Go Modules Projects using the CLI, Snyk does not require their dependencies to be installed, but you must have a `go.mod` file at the root of your Project. `go list` uses this and your Project source code to build a complete dependency tree.

{% hint style="info" %}
Different versions of Go generate different results for the `go list -json -deps` command. This can affect the dependency tree and the vulnerabilities that the Snyk CLI finds.
{% endhint %}

#### **Dep and Snyk CLI**

To build the dependency tree, Snyk analyzes your `Gopkg.lock` files.

When you test dep Projects using the CLI, Snyk requires installation of dependencies. Run `dep ensure` to achieve this.

### Snyk Web UI (Git repository integration)

#### **Go Modules and Git**

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default, dependencies for Go Modules Projects imported using Git are resolved at the module level rather than the package level.

This means you may see more dependencies and issues reported, including potential false positives, than for Projects tested in the CLI.

To avoid this issue and achieve more accurate scans, enable [full source code analysis](go.md#enable-full-source-code-analysis).
{% endhint %}

If full source code analysis is enabled, Snyk uses the `go list -json -deps ./...` command to build the dependency tree the same way the CLI test does. Otherwise, it uses `go mod graph` .

#### Enable full source code analysis

{% hint style="info" %}
Full source code analysis for Go Modules is currently in [Beta](../../getting-started/snyk-release-process.md#open-beta).
{% endhint %}

To build the most accurate dependency tree for Go Modules Projects imported from Git, Snyk needs to access all the files in your repository.

This enables Snyk to see the `import` statements in your `.go` source files, and determine which specific packages are used in your application. Without this access, Snyk will include all packages from the modules listed in your `go.mod` file.

To enable full source code analysis, adjust your settings as follows:

1. Log in to your account and select your Group and Organization.
2. Navigate to **Settings,** then **Languages**.
3. Select **Edit settings** for **Go**.
4. Toggle full source code analysis on or off.

For more details on levels of access to your repository required by different Snyk features, see [How Snyk handles your data](../../working-with-snyk/how-snyk-handles-your-data.md).

#### **Private modules**

Go modules projects that rely on modules from private Git repositories are supported if those repositories are in the same Git organization as the main project repository.

If you have private modules in repositories from other Git organizations, your Project imports may not work properly.

Private module support in different SCMs varies depending on whether [full source code analysis](go.md#enable-full-source-code-analysis) is enabled or disabled.

| Full source code analysis enabled                                                                                                      | Full source code analysis disabled                                       |

#### **Snyk Broker**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Snyk Broker is currently only supported when [full source code analysis](go.md#enable-full-source-code-analysis) is disabled
{% endhint %}

Go Modules Projects imported using new [Snyk Broker](../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/) clients should work as expected.

To add support to clients created before December 30, 2020, add `go.mod` and `go.sum` to your `accept.json` file, as per the changes in this [pull request](https://github.com/snyk/broker/pull/299/files).

If you're using private Go Modules integrated through the Broker, each private module must have a `go.mod` file defined.

#### **Dep and Git**

To build the dependency tree, Snyk analyzes the `Gopkg.lock` files in your Git repository.

### Snyk integrations&#x20;

:link: For integrated development environments, see [Use Snyk in your IDE](../../integrate-with-snyk/ide-tools/).

:link: If you prefer continuous integration/continuous delivery workflows, you can scan with Snyk based on the integration with your automation software (see [Snyk CI/CD](../../integrate-with-snyk/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/) and [Snyk API](../../snyk-api/)).

Containers provide a standard packaging format for applications, but container images can be opaque. This can lead to problems when identifying the software and the vulnerabilities they contain.

Snyk Container provides tools and integrations to quickly find and fix vulnerabilities. This allows you to create images that have security built-in from the start.

## Snyk Container integrations

Snyk Container provides a range of integrations to import Projects into Snyk. These integrations support different workflows.

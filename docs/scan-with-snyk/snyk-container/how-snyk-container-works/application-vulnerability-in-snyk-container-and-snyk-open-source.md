# Application vulnerability in Snyk Container and Snyk Open Source

Snyk Container detects application vulnerabilities in your container and overlaps Snyk Open Source capabilities.\
\
The results from the Snyk Container application vulnerability feature and Snyk Open Source are generally the same, especially if Snyk is building a dependency graph from the same manifest files.\
\
However, depending on the ecosystem and how the developer builds the application, results can vary significantly. An application in a container is a compiled application. So, in some ecosystems, Snyk Open Source can scan a more detailed manifest and thus build a more accurate dependency graph:

* **`golang` Projects for Snyk Containers**: Snyk does not have access to the list of dependencies as in Snyk Open Source. Therefore, Snyk Container reverse parses binaries, and the result differs slightly from Snyk Open Source.
* **`npm` packages as Snyk Containers**: Snyk can have access to the list of dependencies. The result is generally the same as in Snyk Open Source.  Snyk container app-vuln scanning does not currently support npm-workspaces, v3 Lockfiles, or dev dependencies.&#x20;
* **`java` applications for Snyk Containers**: In Open Source, it is possible to include unmanaged jars; see [Scan all unmanaged jar files](../../../snyk-cli/test-for-vulnerabilities/scan-all-unmanaged-jar-files.md). Thus the result is different from Snyk Container. With Snyk Container, the scan traverses all the jars Snyk finds in the image; see [Detecting application vulnerabilities in container images](../use-snyk-container-from-the-web-ui/detect-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images.md). In addition, there are multiple ways to build a jar, and this affects how Snyk Container finds the dependencies.

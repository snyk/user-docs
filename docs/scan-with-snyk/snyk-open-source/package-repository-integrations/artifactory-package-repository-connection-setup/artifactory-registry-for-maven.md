# Artifactory Registry for Maven

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
Package repository integrations are available only with Enterprise plans. For more information, see [plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/).

**Supported projects**\
The Artifactory Package Repository integration supports [Node.js](../../../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/javascript/#supported-frameworks-and-package-managers) (npm and Yarn) and [Maven](../../../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/java-and-kotlin/#supported-frameworks-and-package-managers) Projects. For [Improved Gradle SCM scanning](../../../../supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks/java-and-kotlin/git-repositories-with-maven-and-gradle.md#improved-gradle-scm-scanning-early-access), use the Maven settings on this page.

Snyk can use custom Artifactory Package Repositories with Maven Projects.

This enables Snyk to resolve all direct and transitive dependencies of packages hosted on the custom registry and calculate a more complete, accurate dependency graph and related vulnerabilities.

Maven Projects can be configured to mirror all requests through a custom package repository, or you can specify additional repositories to use alongside Maven Central.

## Set up custom Maven package registries

If authentication is required for access to your custom registry, you must configure the Artifactory package repository integration; see [Artifactory Package Repository connection setup](./).

After the integration is set up, you can configure Maven settings by navigating to **Settings** > **Languages** > **Java**.

You can choose whether to use Artifactory as a mirror or as an additional repository where your artifacts will reside. These settings will be very similar to what you have in `~/.m2/settings.xml`.

## Mirrors

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Maven settings, choose Type</p></figcaption></figure>

Choose a value for the Type, either **Direct** or, if you are using authentication, **Integration**.

If you are using **Direct**, you must complete the **URL**, **Repository Name**, and what it is a **Mirror Of**.

The **Mirror Of** value can either be a `*` to mirror everything, or you can type in a value, for example, `central`.

If you are using the Type **Integration**, you must choose an integration type and provide the **Repository Name** and **Mirror Of** details.

Set the **Repository Name** as whatever comes after `artifactory/` in the internal repository URL.

For example, if the URL is `http://artifactory.company.io/artifactory/libs-release` **Repository Name** should be set as `libs-release`.

## Additional repositories

Alternatively, you can configure repositories that will be used as additional locations to check for artifacts.

Repositories are configured in the same way as [Mirrors](artifactory-registry-for-maven.md#mirrors) but do not require **Mirror Of**.

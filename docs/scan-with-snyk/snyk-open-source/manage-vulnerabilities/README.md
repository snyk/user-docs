# Manage vulnerabilities

The documentation in this section explains how to fix vulnerabilities and license issues in your Projects.

To apply fixes, you can use different methods, including manual application in the Snyk Web UI and automatic pull requests opened by Snyk. See [Fix your vulnerabilities](fix-your-vulnerabilities.md) for more details.

For information about fixability, see [Vulnerability fix types](vulnerability-fix-types.md). For details, see [Upgrade package versions to fix vulnerabilities](upgrade-package-versions-to-fix-vulnerabilities.md) and [Snyk patches to fix vulnerabilities](snyk-patches-to-fix-vulnerabilities.md) for details.

To help you decide which issues to fix, see [Prioritizing and managing issues](../../find-and-manage-priority-issues/).

Fixing vulnerabilities relies on the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](snyk-vulnerability-database.md). You may see [differences in Open Source vulnerability counts across environments](differences-in-open-source-vulnerability-counts-across-environments.md). Information about [troubleshooting](troubleshoot-fixing-open-source-vulnerabilities.md) when you are fixing vulnerabilities is provided.

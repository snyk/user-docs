# Snyk patches to fix vulnerabilities

## Introduction to patches

Sometimes there is no direct upgrade that can address the vulnerability, or an upgrade is not possible due to functional reasons, for example, the upgrade is a major breaking change.

In such cases, Snyk can help you [protect your code with patches](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-protect-package.md). This option will make minimal modifications to your locally installed`node_modules` files to fix the vulnerability. It will also update the policy to patch this issue when you use [@snyk/protect](https://github.com/snyk/cli/tree/master/packages/snyk-protect).

{% hint style="info" %}
Patching is currently supported for **Node.js** Projects only.

Patches are applicable in the following scenarios:

1. When there is no upgrade available for the direct dependency.
2. When there is no way of upgrading a direct dependency to get to a vulnerability-free version of a transitive dependency.
3. When an upgrade would render the package incompatible with the current codebase.

Patches are available through the source code integrations and [@snyk/protect](https://github.com/snyk/cli/tree/master/packages/snyk-protect).

## Process for creating patches

Patches are created and maintained by Snyk. If the package owner has made code changes to fix the issues, our patch is based on this official fix, and we remove any cosmetic or unrelated changes. If a package owner has not addressed the vulnerability yet, we write a patch from scratch.

Before releasing it, we verify the patch, backport it to older versions, and test that the patch hasn’t broken functionality.

The patches are a part of the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](snyk-vulnerability-database.md), so you can check them out before applying them.

## How and when Snyk patches are created

Snyk creates patches for high-impact vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is determined to be high-impact if it is a serious vulnerability in a popular package that affects many users.

The Snyk Security team creates the patch, usually by backporting a fix that has been added to the dependency. Backporting is the action of taking a fix that was built for a particular version of a piece of software and applying it to a previous version of that software. This is done by updating the software to be functionally identical but with the fix for the vulnerability applied. For more information, see Redhat’s description of [Backporting Security Fixes](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting).

After the patch is created by a Snyk Security Engineer, it is reviewed by two other members of the team. The patch is also tested in the following ways:

1. The package is built and tested using the package's automated tests
2. Packages or applications that use that patched package are tested using their automated tests.
3. Custom tests are created and run by the Snyk Security team

All patches are available for download and review by the community, and Snyk welcomes any feedback.

For unmaintained packages, Snyk will create a patch and open a pull request to the Project for the patch to be merged.

## How patches work when you are using the Snyk CLI

For information about patching using the CLI, see [Fix vulnerabilities using the Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/fix-vulnerabilities-using-the-snyk-cli.md).

## How patches work when you are using source code integrations

When you choose to use a patch to fix a vulnerability, `snyk` is added as a dependency, and a `.snyk` file is created that contains the list of patches to apply.

The `.snyk` file contains the details of the patch for each individual path to the dependency, as it may appear in multiple locations in the `node_modules`, for example:

```
'npm:negotiator:20160616':
    - errorhandler > accepts > negotiator:
       patched: '2017-05-05T12:39:16.961Z'
    - negotiator: 
       patched: '2017-05-05T12:39:16.961Z'
```

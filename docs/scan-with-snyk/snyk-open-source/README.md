Developers everywhere use open-source code because it enables fast development. The vast majority of the code making up modern applications is open-source code. This growing reliance exposes organizations to security vulnerabilities and license issues.

Sometimes, these issues are rooted deep in the code. Open-source packages often reference other packages, and it is in these indirect dependencies that many vulnerabilities are found. Developers may not even realize which packages are being called.

Snyk Open Source allows you to find and fix vulnerabilities in the open-source libraries used by your applications. You can also find and address licensing issues in or caused by these open-source libraries.

Snyk Open Source is available in many common languages and platforms. See [Supported languages and package managers](../supported-languages-and-frameworks/supported-languages-frameworks-and-feature-availability-overview.md).

# Automated pull request creation for new fixes

The following rules are applied to the creation of automatic PRs for vulnerabilities:

* Pull requests are created based on the **Test & Automated Pull Request Frequency** notification setting.
* If you select **Retest now** for the Project, a scan runs manually. The 24-hour window is marked as having had the scan run. and no automatic PR is created until the next automated scan runs.
* One pull request is created per Project.
* If **either** the vulnerability is new and has a fix available **or** the fix is new and is not ignored, a Fix PR can be created.
* For known vulnerabilities, see [Configure Automatic fix PRs](automated-fix-pull-requests-for-backlog-issues-and-known-vulnerabilities.md).

To determine when your last 24-hour window began, check the Project issue card for **Snapshot taken by recurring test** and check your email for **\[snyk] Vulnerability alert** for specific scan results:

Pull requests for new vulnerabilities are enabled by default for new integrations.

See the [Git repository SCM integrations](../../../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/) pages for details about supported integrations.

## Enable or disable pull requests for an integration

Follow these steps to enable pull requests at the global integration level:

1. Navigate to settings ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cog\_icon.png) > **Integrations**.
2. Select an SCM integration, for example, GitHub.
3. Enable **New vulnerabilities** and **Save.**

**Apply changes to all overridden projects** will update all of the individual Project settings for **Automatic fix PRs**. If a Project previously had its own settings for automatic fix full requests, clicking the button will override the Project setting with the global setting.

## Enable or disable pull requests for a single Project

Enabling or disabling at a Project level will override the pull request setting for this single Project, so it will not inherit from the global integration setting.

1. Under **Projects,** select a Project and select **Settings**.
2. Select an SCM integration, for example, GitHub.
3. In the **Automatic fix pull requests** section:
   * Select **Customize for only this project**
   * Enable **New vulnerabilities**
   * Select **Save changes**

# Getting started with current IaC

{% hint style="info" %}
The information on this page applies to current IaC. If you are using IaC+, see [Getting started with IaC+](getting-started-with-iac+-and-cloud-scans/).
{% endhint %}

You can use Snyk IaC (Infrastructure as Code) in the [Snyk Web UI](broken-reference) to find, view, and fix issues in configuration files. You can also use Snyk IaC in the Snyk CLI. For details, see [Snyk CLI for Infrastructure as Code](../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/).

On this page, you will find steps to find, view, and fix issues in configuration files for the supported environments: [Terraform](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-terraform-files/), [AWS CloudFormation](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-cloudformation-files/), [Kubernetes](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-kubernetes-configuration-files/), including Helm, and [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-arm-configuration-files.md). These steps are specific to the current IaC. See also [Getting started with IaC+](getting-started-with-iac+-and-cloud-scans/).

## **Prerequisites for Snyk IaC**

Before using Snyk IaC, be sure you have the prerequisites as follows:

* A Snyk account. For details, see [Create a Snyk account](../../getting-started/quickstart/create-or-log-in-to-a-snyk-account.md).
* An existing Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or ARM environment to work in.
* A Git repository you have integrated with Snyk in the same way as for other Snyk products. For details, see [Git repository (SCM)](../../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/).

For more information about IaC and supported environments, see the following pages:

* [Configure your integration to find security issues in your Terraform files](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-terraform-files/configure-your-integration-to-find-security-issues-in-your-terraform-files-current-iac.md)
* [Configure your integration to find security issues in your CloudFormation files](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-cloudformation-files/configure-your-integration-to-find-security-issues-in-your-cloudformation-files-current-iac.md)
* [Configure your integration to find security issues in your Kubernetes configuration files](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-kubernetes-configuration-files/configure-integration-to-find-security-issues-in-kubernetes-configuration-files-current-iac.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
You must use the Snyk CLI to scan ARM configuration files. See [Scan ARM configuration files](scan-your-iac-source-code/scan-arm-configuration-files.md).
{% endhint %}

## Import IaC Projects

You will start by importing [Projects](../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/) you want to scan with Snyk. In these steps, you choose repositories for Snyk to test and re-test:

1. Log in to Snyk and on your dashboard, select **Projects** from the navigation.
2. On the Projects page, from the **Add projects** dropdown, select the SCM where the  repositories and projects are that you want to scan, for example, select GitHub.
3. From the list of **Personal and Organization repositories**, select the Git respsitories and projects you want to import for scanning.\
   You can select one or more repositories or projects in a repository.
4. Click **Add selected repositories** to import the selected SCM projects and repositories into Snyk.
5. Select **View import Log** to see the results on the import log.\
   You can scan multiple types of configuration files simultaneously.\
   The import completes and the Projects page displays the Snyk Project imported.

{% hint style="info" %}
After you have imported an IaC Project, Snyk re-tests your Project once a week by default. You can de-activate recurring tests on the **Settings** tab of the Projects page; Set **Test & Automated Pull Request Frequency** to **Test never**.
{% endhint %}

## View configuration file issues in IaC

On the Projects page, you can view the results for configuration files in the imported Projects.

* If **Group by targets** is selected, a list of [Targets](../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/#target) is displayed. These are the repositories with the Projects you imported. Select a Target to expand its list of Projects.
* If **Group by none** is selected: A list of all [Projects](../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/#project) is displayed.

In your **Projects** listing, select the Project to open to display detailed information about that Project.

Each Project detail page has a **snapshot** showing when the Project was last tested, the name of the user who imported the Project, and, on the **Issues** tab, the number of critical, high, medium, and low-severity issues found and issue cards for each scanned configuration file. You can also select the **Overview**, **History,** and **Settings** options. Choose **History** to see previous snapshots of the Project.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you encounter any errors during import, see the [Importing Projects](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/sections/360000923478-Importing-projects) information in the support articles.

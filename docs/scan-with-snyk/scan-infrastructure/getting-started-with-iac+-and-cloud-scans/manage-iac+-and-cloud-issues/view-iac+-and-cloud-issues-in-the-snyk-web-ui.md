# View IaC+ and cloud issues in the Snyk Web UI

You can view cloud and IaC+ issues for an Organization through the Snyk Web UI.

To view your cloud issues in the Snyk Web UI, navigate to the Organization, and on the menu, select **Cloud.**

By default, Snyk displays open issues across all cloud environments in an Organization. The issues are initially [grouped by the security rule they failed](view-iac+-and-cloud-issues-in-the-snyk-web-ui.md#group-cloud-issues-by-rule), but you can choose to [group them by resource](view-iac+-and-cloud-issues-in-the-snyk-web-ui.md#group-cloud-issues-by-resource).

## Group issues by rule

Issues are grouped by rule by default.

If you have grouped them by resource instead, you can group them by rule again by selecting the **Group by Resource** drop-down menu next to the search bar and selecting **Rule**:

The rules are sorted by severity and then by number of issues, both from highest to lowest.

## Rule details

Each rule shows the following information:

* Severity
  * C: Critical
  * H: High
  * M: Medium
  * L: Low
* Rule title
* Rule ID
* Number of open issues

By default, when you expand a rule by selecting its **Expand row** (`>`) symbol, you see all the resources with an open issue associated with that rule. Each resource shows the following information:

* Resource name
* Environment kind (provider)
* Environment name
* Environment native ID (Amazon Web Services account ID, Google project ID, Azure subscription, and so on)
* Resource tags
* Age of issue

## Group issues by resource

If issues are currently grouped by rule, you can group them by resource instead by selecting the **Group by Rule** drop-down menu next to the search bar and selecting **Resource**:

The resources are sorted by severity of issue and then by number of issues, both from highest to lowest.

## Resource details

Each resource shows the following information:

* Resource name
* Resource type
* Environment kind
* Environment name
* Environment native ID
* Resource tags
* Severity of open issues
* Number of issues for each severity

By default, when you expand a resource by selecting its **Expand row** (`>`) symbol, you see all the rules with an open issue associated with that resource.

Each rule shows the following information:

* Severity
* Rule title
* Rule category
* Rule ID
* Age of issue

## View issue details on issue summary panel

To view an issue, select the **Expand row** (`>`) symbol on the left side of a row, then select a corresponding resource or rule. Snyk displays a panel with the cloud issue details.

The cloud issue summary panel displays the **Overview** by default, which contains the following information:

* Severity
* Status (open or closed)
* Resource details:
  * Native ID (Amazon Resource Name); AWS only
  * Name
  * Type
  * Location (AWS region, Google project, Azure subscription, Terraform file, and so on)
  * Input type (`cloud_scan`, `tf_hcl`, and so on)
  * Platform (`aws`, `google`, `azure`, and so on)
  * ID
* Environment details:
  * Name
  * Native ID (AWS account ID, Google project, Azure subscription, `:cli`, and so on)
  * Kind (AWS, Google, Azure, CLI, and so on)
  * ID
* Rule details:
  * Title
  * Category
  * Severity
  * ID, with a link to fix advice
  * Rule description (**Why to fix it** section)

## Filter issues

To filter which cloud issues are shown:

1. Select the **Filter** drop-down menu. The name of the menu shows how many filters are selected, for example, **1 Filter**.
2. Select the parameter you want to filter by, for example, **Severity**.
3. Check the box for the values you want to show, for example, **High**.

By default, the **Status** filter is set to include only **open** issues.

You can also filter issues by compliance control, resource type, environment name, and more.

## Search issues

As you select filters from the **Filters** drop-down menu, the search bar is populated with key-value pairs.

To search cloud issues by key-value pair:

1. Select the search bar.
2. Select a key from the drop-down list, or type in a key from the list of available filters.
3. Select a value from the drop-down list, or type in a value.

To remove a key-value pair, select the **X** or press the **Delete** key on your keyboard.

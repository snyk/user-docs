# Ignoring cloud and IaC+ issues

You can ignore a cloud or IaC+ [issue](./) from the Snyk Web UI.

Ignoring an issue can be useful if the rule that generated the issue is irrelevant for a resource or if you want to defer fixing the issue to a later date.

For example, you might want to permanently ignore an issue resulting from the rule "S3 bucket does not have `block_public_acls` enabled" for an S3 bucket that is meant to be public.

Or, you may temporarily suppress the issue to address it in the future.

Ignores are applied at the Organization level.

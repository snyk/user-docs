# Bundling rules

When you are ready, you can **build a custom rules bundle** by running the following command:

```
snyk-iac-rules build
```

If you have more than your generated rules in the current folder, consider using the `--ignore` option to exclude the folders and files irrelevant to a production-ready bundle. This can both speed up the process and ensure the size of the generated bundle stays small.

You can **override the default entry point**. If you have chosen to name the rule that evaluates something different from **`deny`**, for example, `allow`,`violation`and so on, you can override it by running:

```
snyk-iac-rules build --entrypoint "<package name>/<function name>"
```

Finally, you can **check the contents of the bundle without extracting it** by running:

```
tar -tf bundle.tar.gz
```

The output will be all the files included in the bundle:

```
/data.json
/lib/main.rego
/rules/MY_RULE/main.rego
/policy.wasm
/.manifest
```

You can now [run snyk iac test with your newly built custom bundle.](../use-iac-custom-rules-with-cli/)

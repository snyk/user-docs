# Snyk IaC with Broker for self-hosted Git

Snyk Broker enables you to connect your local Git server to Snyk if the Git server is not internet-reachable.

By default, Snyk Broker allows only information for Snyk Open Source and Docker files to go through. If you also want to analyze Infrastructure as Code files, such as `.tf` or `.yaml`, you must configure the Broker to do so.

For details, see [Snyk Broker - Infrastructure as Code detection](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-infrastructure-as-code-detection/). For more information about Snyk Broker, see the [Broker](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/) docs.

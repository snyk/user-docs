# Scan Serverless files

Snyk IaC currently supports scanning of Serverless configuration files **only** via the CLI.

Users can share their Serverless scan results with the platform and present them in the UI by using the [Share CLI results feature](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/share-cli-results-with-the-snyk-web-ui.md).

For more information, see [Test your Serverless files with Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/test-your-iac-files/serverless-files.md).

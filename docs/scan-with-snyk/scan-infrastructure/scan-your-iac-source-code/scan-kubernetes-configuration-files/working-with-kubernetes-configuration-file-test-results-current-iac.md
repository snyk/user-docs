# Working with Kubernetes configuration file test results (current IaC)

{% hint style="info" %}
This page applies to current IaC only.
{% endhint %}

After you have imported your configuration file, Snyk continuously monitors the repository for any related changes, re-testing your file at regular intervals based on the configurations in your settings. Recommendations are based on the relevant settings that your administrator configures and manages. See [Configure integration to find security issues in Kubernetes configuration files](configure-integration-to-find-security-issues-in-kubernetes-configuration-files-current-iac.md).

Click the Project link to view test results and resolve any misconfigurations that may pose security issues.

The results page looks similar to the following:

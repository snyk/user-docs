# Configure integration to find security issues in Kubernetes configuration files (current IaC)

{% hint style="info" %}
This page applies to current IaC only.
{% endhint %}

Snyk tests and monitors Kubernetes configurations stored in your source code repositories and provides information, tips, and tricks to better [secure a Kubernetes environment](https://snyk.io/learn/kubernetes-security/). This helps to catch misconfigurations before they are pushed to production, as well as provide fixes for vulnerabilities.

## Supported Git repositories and Kubernetes file formats

Snyk currently scans your Kubernetes configuration files in JSON and YAML format when they are imported from your integrated Git repository.

## Configure Snyk to scan Kubernetes configuration files

### **Prerequisites for scanning Kubernetes configuration files**

* Administrator access for the Organization
* Git repository access and authorization\
  For details, see [Git repository (SCM) integrations](../../../../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/).

### **Configure Snyk to scan Kubernetes configuration files**

* Log in to the Snyk Web UI ([app.snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io)), and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization that you want to manage.\
  Integrations are managed per Organization.
* To enable Snyk to detect Kubernetes configuration files, in the Infrastructure as Code settings, toggle the setting to enable Snyk to detect Infrastructure as code files.
* If needed, review and adjust the **Infrastructure as code** **Severity settings** on the Kubernetes tab in the example.\
  Check to select the file types to scan, CloudFormation, Terraform, or both, and from the pulldown selection, choose the severity level for each Deployment.

# Risk Score

{% hint style="info" %}
Risk Score is currently in [Early Access](../getting-started/snyk-release-process.md) for Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container. Use [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/manage-settings/snyk-preview) to replace the Priority Score with the new Risk Score.
{% endhint %}

The Snyk Risk Score is a single value assigned to an issue, applied by automatic risk analysis for each security issue. Risk Score is based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability. Ranging from 0 to 1,000, the score represents the risk imposed on your environment and enables a risk-based prioritization approach.&#x20;

Since real risk is scarce, you should expect a significant drift in the distribution of scores, as can be seen in this example of Project score distributions:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="Example Project scores distribution"><figcaption><p>Example Project scores distribution</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Risk Score replaces the Priority Score directly. See the [priority score docs](../scan-with-snyk/find-and-manage-priority-issues/priority-score.md) for how to interact with the Risk Score in the UI, API, and Reports, where the Risk Score is now introduced when enabled. Risk Score is not available in the CLI.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Priority Score will be replaced with the Risk Score when Snyk Open Source and Snyk Container Projects are re-tested
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that in the API, the relevant fields are still named with `priority.`When Risk Score is enabled, the scores and factors populated in these fields are based on the Risk Score model as part of the beta,&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## About the Risk Score Model&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/matrix (2).png" alt="he Snyk Risk Score Model"><figcaption><p>The Snyk Risk Score Model</p></figcaption></figure>

The model that powers the Risk Score applies automatic risk analysis for each security issue based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Risk Model results from extensive research conducted by the Snyk Security Data Science team and experienced security researchers. The model draws on expertise gained over the years in developing the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/).
{% endhint %}

### Impact subscore

Objective impact factors are the CVSS impact metrics, Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Scope, calculated based on the CVSS impact subscore. For Container issues, Provider Urgency is also taken into account.&#x20;

The business criticality Project attribute will be taken into account as a contextual impact factor, increasing or decreasing the impact subscore. For more information, see [Project attributes](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md).

### Likelihood subscore&#x20;

Objective likelihood factors are taken into account:

* Exploit Maturity
* Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)&#x20;
* Age of advisory&#x20;
* CVSS exploitability metrics: Attack vector, Privileges required, User interaction, and Scope
* Social Trends
* Malicious Package
* Provider Urgency (Snyk Container)
* Package popularity (Snyk Open Source)&#x20;
* (Forthcoming) Disputed vulnerability

Contextual likelihood factors then increase or decrease the likelihood subscore: &#x20;

* Reachability (Snyk Open Source Java only, JavaScript to be supported)&#x20;
* Transitive depth
* (Forthcoming) Insights such as `Deployed` , `OS condition` and `Public Facing`

{% hint style="info" %}
Fixability is no longer considered part of the Score Calculation, as the effort needed to mitigate a security issue does not affect the risk it imposes. To focus on actionable issues, use Fixability filters and then use the Risk Score to start with the riskiest issues.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% endhint %}

### Contextual likelihood risk factors

#### Transitive depth&#x20;

Building on [past studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07972.pdf), Snyk research has shown that if a vulnerability is introduced to a Project transitively rather than directly, it is less likely that an exploitable function path will exist.\
**Possible input values:** `Direct dependency`, `Indirect dependency`, `Great transitive depth` _(forthcoming)_

{% hint style="info" %}
**How would this affect the score?**&#x20;

_Direct Dependency_ - Likelihood subscore will not change &#x20;

_Indirect Dependency_ - Likelihood subscore will decrease

_Great transitive depth -_ Likelihood subscore will decrease significantly (coming soon)
{% endhint %}

#### Reachability&#x20;

Snyk static code analysis determines whether the vulnerable method is being called. This is currently supported only in Java; JavaScript support is coming soon. For more information, see [Reachable vulnerabilities](../scan-with-snyk/find-and-manage-priority-issues/reachable-vulnerabilities.md).\
**Possible input values:** `Reachable`, `No path found`\
When Reachability is not enabled, the Likelihood subscore will not change, and the factor will not show up.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How would this affect the score?**&#x20;

`Reachable` - Likelihood subscore will increase, and transitive depth will not be considered.&#x20;

_`No path found`_ - Likelihood subscore will not change
{% endhint %}

# View dependencies

The **Dependencies** tab acts as a Bill Of Materials (BOM) for all dependencies in all Projects in the selected Organization. This allows you to quickly and easily identify which Projects have a specific version of a dependency.

Dependency reports show details about the packages included in your Projects, including their full names, the version of the package currently used, the Projects in which they are used, and a summary of the issues they contain:

Examining the details for each package can help you determine the dependency health of your packages.

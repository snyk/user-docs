# REST API

This section provides an [introduction to the REST API](about-the-rest-api.md) and a resource to help you [get started](getting-started-with-the-rest-api.md).

For more information, see [Authentication for API](../authentication-for-api/) and the [Changelog](../changelog.md) of updates to the [Reference](../reference/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the date updated in the changelog is not a valid version number. The valid version number precedes the date updated in each section. For example, in the section "2024-10-15 - Updated 2025-02-11," `2024-10-15` is the valid version number.
{% endhint %}

# Snyk Integrations

Snyk integrates with many languages, platforms, and systems, including:

* [**Git repository (SCM) integrations**](git-repository-scm-integrations/), such as GitHub, to connect your code repo to Snyk, and use Snyk's facilities to automatically generate PRs for package upgrades to fix vulnerabilities.
* [**IDEs**](../ide-tools/): such as Visual Studio, to integrate Snyk plugins or extensions fully in your development environment.
* [**CI / CD integration**](ci-cd-integrations/), **** such as Circle CI. Many users start with these integrations; also see information on [setting up](ci-cd-integrations/#setting-up) and [configuring Snyk integrations](ci-cd-integrations/#configure-your-continuous-integration).
* [**Notification and ticketing systems**](notifications-ticketing-system-integrations/) **** such as Slack or Jira, to provide notifications about new vulnerabilities that affect your projects and about new upgrades or patches that have become available.
* [**Vulnerability management tools**](vulnerability-management-tools/): such as RiskSense, to incorporate your software composition analysis (SCA) data with your application risk management solution.
* [**Private registry gatekeeper plugins**](private-registry-gatekeeper-plugins/) and [**private registry integrations**](private-registry-integrations/) such as Artifactory, to scan your artifacts for open source vulnerabilities and license issues.
* [**Serverless integrations**](serverless-integrations/) such as Azure functions, letting you monitor deployed code for any known vulnerabilities found in the application's dependencies, testing at a frequency you control.
* [**Platform as a Service integrations**](platform-as-a-service-integrations/) **** such as Heroku. See [Platform as a service integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/platform-as-a-service-integrations).

# Kenna Security

## Introduction to Snyk and Kenna Security Integration

Snyk and Kenna.VM provides direct insight into security flaws in open source code and presents this information in the context of all vulnerability data sources, enabling organizations to understand their security threat landscapes and to prioritize vulnerability fixing.

## How it Works

**Feature availability**\
This integration relies on the Snyk API which is only available to paid Snyk plans. [Find out more about the API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#), or [review your own plan and start a free trial](https://app.snyk.io/manage/billing) to experience the full value Snyk offers.

The connector leverages the Kenna Security [toolkit](https://github.com/KennaPublicSamples/toolkit) and the [Kenna Data Importer](https://help.kennasecurity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026413111-Kenna-Data-Importer-JSON-Connector-) format. The Kenna toolkit uses the Snyk API to retrieve project issues, format the results, and ingest it into Kenna.VM. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Retrieve the Snyk API Key from the Snyk UI - [Service Account page](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/managing-integrations/service-accounts)
2. Retrieve the [Kenna API Key](https://help.kennasecurity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029111331-API-Key-Generation-and-Permissions) from the Kenna UI
3. Retrieve the [Kenna Connector ID](https://help.kennasecurity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026413111-Kenna-Data-Importer-JSON-Connector-)
4. Run the Snyk task following the guidelines on the main [toolkit help page](https://github.com/KennaPublicSamples/toolkit#calling-a-specific-task)
5. Add Snyk task command-line options - [List of available Snyk Task options](https://github.com/KennaSecurity/toolkit/tree/main/tasks/connectors/snyk\_v2)

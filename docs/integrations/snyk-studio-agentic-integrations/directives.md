# Directives

Directives allow security and engineering teams to govern how AI coding assistants operate across your organization, ensuring adherence to security policy, code standards, and approved workflows.

They have varying names across different coding assistants. For example, rules, instructions, commands, memories, skills, knowledge, workflows, hooks, and so on.

Snyk categorizes anything that guides an agent to produce code a certain way under the term "Directives" and offers code examples that you can use as they are, or customized to meet your needs.

Snyk categorizes directives into the following types:

* [Guardrail directives](directives.md#guardrail-directives)
* [Command directives](directives.md#command-directives)

{% hint style="info" %}
Different coding assistants may require a different header or formatting for directives. Check the coding assistant's official documentation for formatting instructions.
{% endhint %}

## Guardrail directives

Guardrail directives are automatically injected into agent interactions. They govern agent behavior by providing persistent context, setting security policies, and enforcing compliance rules.

Coding assistants have different mechanisms for how these types of directives are applied, but they are either appended to prompts or injected into the workflow when relevant.

{% hint style="info" %}
Non-determinism is a factor with LLM interactions and there can be scenarios where coding assistants do not append directives to prompts.
{% endhint %}

There are many guardrail directives that your company may choose to implement, some of which may relate to security.

### Secure at inception directives

Snyk Secure at inception directives are code examples that can be used to ensure that AI-generated code is tested for security issues at the time of code generation.

The following directives can be customized to fit your organization needs.

<details>

<summary>Secure at inception: SAST</summary>

The following code snippet establishes the SAST constraint for new code and guides the agent through the mandated validation and remediation process:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
- Always run snyk_code_scan tool for new first party code that is generated in a Snyk-supported language.

- If any security issues are found based on newly introduced or modified code or dependencies, attempt to fix the issues using the results context from Snyk.
- Rescan the code after fixing the issues to ensure that the issues were fixed and that there are no newly introduced issues.
- Repeat this process until no new issues are found.
```
{% endcode %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>Secure at inception: All Snyk products</summary>

The following code snippet extends the Secure at inception testing to include checks for Snyk Code, Snyk Open Source, Snyk Container, and Snyk IaC:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
- Always run snyk_code_scan tool for new first party code that is generated in a Snyk-supported language.
- Always run snyk_sca_scan tool when dependencies are added or updated.
- Always run snyk_container_scan tool when container images are built or referenced.
- Always run snyk_iac_scan tool when Infrastructure as Code files are created or modified.

- If any security issues are found based on newly introduced or modified code or dependencies, attempt to fix the issues using the results context from Snyk.
- Rescan the code after fixing the issues to ensure that the issues were fixed and that there are no newly introduced issues.
- Repeat this process until no new issues are found.
```
{% endcode %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>Secure at inception: Package health check [Experimental]</summary>

The `snyk_package_health_check` directive evaluates open-source packages for security vulnerabilities, maintenance health, community engagement, and popularity. This reduces supply chain risk in agentic development workflows where AI agents autonomously select and install dependencies.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `snyk_package_health_check` is available only for npm, pypi, nuget, maven, and golang.
{% endhint %}

Snyk Studio provides two ready-to-use sample scripts that integrate `snyk_package_health_check` into your development workflow: a skill for proactive package selection and a hook for enforcing security gates on package installations.

### Skill: Secure dependency health check

This skill evaluates and compares open-source packages for AI agents.

When a developer requests a recommendation or an agent imports a dependency, the skill runs `snyk_package_health_check` on each candidate. The tool returns a structured comparison including:

* Overall health rating
* Vulnerability counts by severity
* Maintenance and community ratings
* Popularity metrics

The agent uses these signals to recommend packages with clear reasoning or flag packages to avoid because of security issues or inactive maintenance.

Install this skill to evaluate packages before recommending or adding them.

You can:

* Compare multiple candidates for the same functionality.
* Check if an existing dependency is safe.
* Find a secure alternative to a vulnerable package.

To use this skill, refer to the sample script in the [Snyk Studio recipes repository](https://github.com/snyk/studio-recipes/tree/feat/package-health-checks/command_directives/synchronous_remediation/skills/secure-dependency-health-check).

### Hook: Enforce security scan on new packages

{% hint style="info" %}
The `snyk_package_health_check` hook works only with Cursor.
{% endhint %}

The Enforce Security Scan hook implements a security gate for the Cursor IDE. Install this hook to enforce a policy that prevents installing new dependencies without a security check.&#x20;

When an AI agent modifies a package manifest, for example, `package.json`, the hook blocks install commands, like `npm install`, until the `snyk_package_health_check` runs. After the agent invokes the health check, the install commands proceed. If a session ends with unscanned manifest changes, the hook displays a warning.

The hook operates in the background and requires no developer intervention. This suits teams that want consistent guardrails across all agent coding sessions.

To use this hook, refer to the sample script in the [Snyk Studio recipes repository](https://github.com/snyk/studio-recipes/tree/feat/package-health-checks/guardrail_directives/package_enforcement/cursor/hooks).

### How to use the sample scripts

Sample scripts are available in the [studio-recipes repository](https://github.com/snyk/studio-recipes).&#x20;

To use them:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Copy the skill or hook directory into your project's `.cursor/` configuration.
3. Ensure the [Snyk MCP server](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-studio-agentic-integrations/getting-started-with-snyk-studio) is configured, and you have an authenticated Snyk account.

</details>

## Command directives

Command directives are manually invoked by human developers or agents. They codify and standardize complex, multi-step engineering and security playbooks.

### Remediation directives

Remediation directives, a category of command directive, trigger a full, end-to-end security remediation playbook that results in a secure pull request.

There are many command directives that companies may choose to implement, some of which may relate to security. Snyk remediation directives are code examples that can be used to accelerate the remediation of pre-existing security issues.

The following directive can be customized to fit your organization's specific needs.

<details>

<summary>End-to-end vulnerability resolution</summary>

This directive content guides the agent to:

* Execute one or more security tests.
* Filter the results if any parameters are provided.
* Rescan to validate the security fix resolved the issues and did not introduce new ones.

Once executed, a pull request can be generated to review, approve, and merge into the codebase.

This directive is invoked by calling the directive in an agent chat interaction, for example, `/snyk-fix`. This is invoked without any arguments, which results in any detected findings being remediated, or it is invoked with specific Snyk product filters or other indications of which resulting findings should be fixed:

{% code title="snyk-fix.md" overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}

# Snyk Fix (All-in-One)

## Overview
Complete security remediation workflow in a single command. Scans for vulnerabilities, fixes them, validates the fix, and optionally creates a PR.

**Workflow**: Parse → Scan → Analyze → Fix → Validate → Summary → (Optional) PR

## Example Usage

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/snyk-fix` | Auto-detect scan type, fix highest priority issue (all instances) |
| `/snyk-fix code` | SAST scan only, fix highest priority code issue (all instances in file) |
| `/snyk-fix sca` | SCA scan only, fix highest priority dependency issue |
| `/snyk-fix SNYK-JS-LODASH-1018905` | Fix specific Snyk issue by ID |
| `/snyk-fix CVE-2021-44228` | Find and fix specific CVE |
| `/snyk-fix lodash` | Fix highest priority issue in lodash package |
| `/snyk-fix server.ts` | Code scan on file, fix highest priority issue (all instances) |
| `/snyk-fix sca express` | Fix highest priority issue in express package |
| `/snyk-fix XSS` | Fix all XSS vulnerabilities in highest priority file |
| `/snyk-fix path traversal` | Fix all path traversal vulnerabilities |

---

## Phase 1: Input Parsing

Parse user input to extract:
- **scan_type**: Explicit (`code`, `sca`, `both`) or infer from context
- **target_vulnerability**: Specific issue ID, CVE, package name, file reference, or vulnerability type
- **target_path**: File or directory to focus on (defaults to project root)

### Scan Type Detection Rules (in priority order)

1. **Explicit code**: User says "code", "sast", "static" → Code scan
2. **Explicit sca**: User says "sca", "dependency", "package", "npm", "pip", "maven" → SCA scan
3. **Vulnerability ID provided**: 
   - Starts with `SNYK-` → run both scans to locate it
   - Contains `CVE-` → run both scans to find it
4. **Vulnerability type provided**: User mentions type like "XSS", "SQL injection", "path traversal" → Code scan
5. **File reference**: User mentions `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, etc. file → Code scan on that file
6. **Package reference**: User mentions known package name (e.g., "lodash", "express") → SCA scan
7. **Default (no hints)**: Run BOTH scans, select highest priority issue

---

## Phase 2: Discovery

**Goal**: Run scan(s) and identify the vulnerability type to fix, including ALL instances of that type in the same file (for code vulnerabilities)

### Step 2.1: Run Security Scan(s)

Based on scan type detection:
- **Code only**: Run `snyk_code_scan` with `path` set to project root or specific file
- **SCA only**: Run `snyk_sca_scan` with `path` set to project root
- **Both**: Run both scans in parallel

### Step 2.2: Select Target Vulnerability Type

**If user specified a vulnerability:**
- Search scan results for matching issue (by ID, CVE, package name, vulnerability type, or description)
- If NOT found: Report "Vulnerability not found in scan results" and STOP
- If found: Note whether it's a Code or SCA issue

**If user did NOT specify a vulnerability:**
- From ALL scan results, select the highest priority vulnerability TYPE using this priority:
  1. Critical severity with known exploit
  2. Critical severity
  3. High severity with known exploit  
  4. High severity
  5. Medium severity
  6. Low severity
- Within same priority: prefer issues with available fixes/upgrades

### Step 2.3: Group All Instances (Code Vulnerabilities Only)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT for Code vulnerabilities**: After selecting the vulnerability type, find ALL instances of that same vulnerability type in the same file:

- Same vulnerability ID (e.g., `javascript/PT`, `javascript/XSS`, `python/SQLi`)
- In the same file

**Example**: If scan finds:
```
High    Path Traversal    src/api/files.ts:45    javascript/PT
High    Path Traversal    src/api/files.ts:112   javascript/PT  
High    XSS               src/api/files.ts:78    javascript/XSS
```

And Path Traversal is selected as highest priority, target BOTH lines 45 and 112.

### Step 2.4: Document Target

**For Code vulnerabilities:**
```
## Target Vulnerability
- **Type**: Code (SAST)
- **ID**: [Snyk ID] (e.g., javascript/PT)
- **Severity**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
- **Title**: [vulnerability title]
- **CWE**: [CWE-XXX if available]
- **Instances to Fix**: [count]

| # | File | Line | Description |
|---|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | [file] | [line] | [brief context] |
| 2 | [file] | [line] | [brief context] |
```

**For SCA vulnerabilities:**
```
## Target Vulnerability
- **Type**: SCA (Dependency)
- **ID**: [Snyk Issue ID]
- **Severity**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
- **Package**: [package@current_version]
- **Title**: [vulnerability title]
- **Fix Version**: [minimum version that fixes]
- **Dependency Path**: [direct | transitive via X → Y → Z]
```

---

## Phase 3: Remediation (Code Vulnerabilities)

**Skip to Phase 4 if this is an SCA vulnerability.**

### Step 3.1: Understand the Vulnerability
- Read the affected file and ALL vulnerable locations
- Identify the vulnerability type:
  - **Injection** (SQL, Command, LDAP, etc.)
  - **XSS** (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - **Path Traversal**
  - **Sensitive Data Exposure**
  - **Insecure Deserialization**
  - **Security Misconfiguration**
  - **Cryptographic Issues**
  - Other (check Snyk description)
- Review Snyk's remediation guidance if provided
- Look for patterns across instances (often the same fix approach applies)

### Step 3.2: Plan the Fix

Before implementing, document the approach:
```
## Fix Plan
- **Vulnerability Type**: [type]
- **Root Cause**: [why the code is vulnerable]
- **Fix Approach**: [what will be changed]
- **Security Mechanism**: [what protection is being added]
- **Instances Affected**: [count] locations in [file]
```

Common fix patterns:
| Vulnerability | Fix Pattern |
|---------------|-------------|
| SQL Injection | Parameterized queries / prepared statements |
| Command Injection | Input validation + shell escaping or avoid shell |
| Path Traversal | Canonicalize path + validate against allowed base |
| XSS | Output encoding / sanitization appropriate to context |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | Remove/mask data, use secure headers |
| Hardcoded Secrets | Move to environment variables / secrets manager |

### Step 3.3: Apply the Fix to ALL Instances

- Fix ALL identified instances of the vulnerability type in the file
- Apply consistent fix pattern across all instances
- Make the minimal code change needed at each location
- Prefer standard library/framework security features over custom solutions
- Consider creating a shared helper function if:
  - 3+ instances exist with identical fix pattern
  - The helper improves readability without over-engineering
- Add comments explaining security-relevant changes if non-obvious
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT change business logic

**Order of fixes**: Fix from bottom of file to top (highest line number first) to avoid line number shifts affecting subsequent fixes.

**Continue to Phase 5 (Validation).**

---

## Phase 4: Remediation (SCA Vulnerabilities)

**Skip to Phase 5 if this is a Code vulnerability (already handled in Phase 3).**

### Step 4.1: Analyze Dependency Path
- Document the full dependency path (direct → transitive → vulnerable)
- Identify manifest files to modify (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- Determine if vulnerable package is direct or transitive

**For transitive dependencies:**
- Identify which direct dependency pulls in the vulnerable transitive
- Check if upgrading the direct dependency will pull in the fixed transitive
- If app directly imports the transitive: note this for breaking change analysis

### Step 4.2: Check for Breaking Changes
Search codebase for potential impact:
```bash
# Search for imports of the package
grep -r "from 'package'" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
grep -r "require('package')" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```

If complex breaking changes detected:
- Add TODO comments with migration notes
- Note in summary that manual review is needed

### Step 4.3: Apply Minimal Upgrade
- Edit ONLY the necessary dependency in the manifest
- Use the LOWEST version that fixes the vulnerability
- Preserve file formatting and comments

**Example (package.json):**
```json
// Before
"lodash": "^4.17.15"

// After - minimal fix
"lodash": "^4.17.21"
```

### Step 4.4: Regenerate Lockfile

Run the appropriate install command:

| Package Manager | Command |
|-----------------|---------|
| npm (major upgrade) | `npm install <pkg>@<version>` |
| npm (minor/patch) | `npm install` |
| yarn | `yarn install` or `yarn upgrade <pkg>@<version>` |
| pip | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| maven | `mvn dependency:resolve` |

**IMPORTANT**: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for package manager commands.

**If installation fails:**
- If sandbox/permission issue: retry with elevated permissions
- If dependency conflict: try a different version or note as unfixable
- Revert manifest changes if resolution completely fails
- Document the failure reason

---

## Phase 5: Validation

### Step 5.1: Re-run Security Scan
- Run `snyk_code_scan` or `snyk_sca_scan` on the same target
- Verify ALL targeted vulnerability instances are NO LONGER reported

**For Code vulnerabilities - If any instances still present:**
- Review the fix attempt for that specific instance
- Try alternative approach
- Maximum 3 total attempts per instance, then report partial success/failure

**For SCA vulnerabilities - If vulnerability still present:**
- Check if lockfile was properly updated
- Try explicit version install: `npm install <pkg>@<exact_version>`
- Maximum 3 attempts, then STOP and report failure

**If NEW vulnerabilities introduced:**

*For Code:*
- Code fixes must be clean — no new vulnerabilities allowed
- Attempt to fix any new issues introduced by your fix
- Iterate until clean (max 3 total attempts)
- If unable to produce clean fix: Revert ALL changes and report failure

*For SCA:*
- Check severity trade-off:
  - **New severity LOWER than fixed**: Accept (net security improvement)
  - **New severity EQUAL OR HIGHER**: Try higher version (up to 3 iterations)
  - If no clean version exists: Revert and report as unfixable

### Step 5.1a: Identify Additional Issues Fixed (SCA Only)
A single upgrade often fixes multiple vulnerabilities:
- Compare pre-fix and post-fix scan results
- Identify ALL vulnerabilities resolved by this upgrade
- Record each: ID, severity, title

### Step 5.2: Run Tests
- Execute project tests (`npm test`, `pytest`, etc.)
- If tests fail due to the fix:
  - Prefer adjusting the fix over changing tests
  - Only modify tests if the fix legitimately changes expected behavior
  - Apply mechanical fixes only (renamed imports, etc.)
  - Maximum 2 attempts to resolve test failures

### Step 5.3: Run Linting
- Run project linter if configured
- Fix any formatting issues introduced

---

## Phase 6: Summary & PR Prompt

### Step 6.1: Display Remediation Summary

**For Code vulnerabilities (single or multiple instances):**
```
## Remediation Summary

| Remediated Vulnerability | [Title] ([CWE-XXX]) |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Snyk ID** | [javascript/PT, python/XSS, etc.] |
| **Severity** | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] |
| **Instances Fixed** | [count] |

| # | File | Line | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | [file] | [line] | ✅ Fixed |
| 2 | [file] | [line] | ✅ Fixed |

### What Was Fixed
[2-3 sentence plain-English explanation of the vulnerability and how it was fixed. No code snippets.]

### Validation

| Tests | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Skipped (reason) / ❌ Fail |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## Should I create a PR for this fix? (yes / no)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**For SCA vulnerabilities:**
```
## Remediation Summary

| Remediated Vulnerability | [Title] |
|--------------------------|---------|
| **Snyk ID** | [SNYK-JS-XXX / CVE-XXX] |
| **Severity** | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] |

|----|----------|-------|
| [Snyk ID] | [severity] | [title] |

**Total issues fixed**: [count]

### What Was Fixed
[2-3 sentence plain-English explanation of the vulnerability and how it was fixed.]

### Validation

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Snyk Re-scan | ✅ Resolved / ❌ Still present |
| TypeScript/Build | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail |
| Linting | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail |
| Tests | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Skipped (reason) / ❌ Fail |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## Should I create a PR for this fix? (yes / no)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Rules for this summary:**
- Do NOT include code snippets (before/after)
- Do NOT list remaining issues in codebase
- Keep "What Was Fixed" to 2-3 sentences max
- Use visual separator (━) around PR prompt to make it stand out

### Step 6.2: Send Feedback to Snyk
After successful fix, report the remediation:
```
snyk_send_feedback with:
- fixedExistingIssuesCount: [total issues fixed]
- preventedIssuesCount: 0
- path: [absolute project path]
```

### Step 6.3: Wait for User Response

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed until the user explicitly confirms.

---

## Phase 7: Create PR (If Confirmed)

**Only execute if user says "yes" to PR prompt.**

### Step 7.1: Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

**Verify:**
- There are uncommitted changes (staged or unstaged)
- The changes are related to the security fix

**If no changes found:** Report "No uncommitted changes to commit" and STOP

### Step 7.2: Create Branch

**Format**: `fix/security-<identifier>`

**Examples:**
- `fix/security-SNYK-JS-LODASH-1018905`
- `fix/security-cwe-79-xss`
- `fix/security-path-traversal-server`
- `fix/security-lodash-upgrade`

```bash
git checkout -b fix/security-<identifier>
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for all git operations.

### Step 7.3: Stage and Commit

Stage only files related to the security fix:
```bash
git add <files>
```

**Do NOT stage:**
- Unrelated changes
- IDE/editor files
- Build artifacts

Create commit:
```bash
git commit -m "fix(security): <description>

Resolves: [Snyk ID or CVE]
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` to avoid SSH/signing failures.

### Step 7.4: Push Branch
```bash
git push -u origin fix/security-<identifier>
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for network access.

### Step 7.5: Create Pull Request
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "Security: <title>" \
  --body "<body>" \
  --base main
```

**PR Body Template:**
```markdown
## Security Fix

### Vulnerability Details
- **ID**: [Snyk ID or CVE]
- **Severity**: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
- **Type**: [SCA | Code]

### Changes Made
[Description of the fix]

### Files Changed
- [list files]

### Validation
- [x] Snyk scan passes
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] No new vulnerabilities introduced
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for network access
- Do NOT use `--label` flags (labels may not exist in repo)

### Step 7.6: Output Confirmation

```
## PR Created Successfully

- **PR URL**: [URL]
- **Branch**: fix/security-<identifier>
- **Title**: [PR title]
- **Status**: Ready for review

### Next Steps
1. Review the PR at the URL above
2. Request reviews from team members
3. Merge when approved
```

---

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- Run `snyk_auth` and retry once
- If still failing: STOP and ask user to authenticate manually

### Scan Timeout/Failure
- Retry once
- If still failing: STOP and report the error

### Vulnerability Not Found
- If user specified a vulnerability that doesn't appear in scan results
- Report clearly and STOP (don't guess or fix something else)

### Unfixable Code Vulnerability
If the vulnerability cannot be fixed automatically:
1. Document why it cannot be fixed (complex refactoring needed, unclear fix, etc.)
2. Add TODO comment in the affected file with context
3. Report to user with manual remediation suggestions
4. Do NOT leave partial/broken fixes

### SCA - No Fix Available
If no upgrade path exists:
1. Document this clearly
2. Suggest alternatives (replace package, patch, accept risk)
3. Do NOT make changes

### Partial Success (Code)
If some instances are fixed but others fail:
1. Keep the successful fixes
2. Document which instances remain unfixed and why
3. Add TODO comments for unfixed instances
4. Report partial success in summary with clear breakdown

### Rollback Triggers
Revert ALL changes if:
- Unable to produce clean fix after 3 attempts (new vulnerabilities introduced)
- Tests fail and cannot be reasonably fixed
- Fix would require changing business logic
- Dependency resolution completely fails

### Git/PR Errors
| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Not a git repository | STOP - cannot create PR |
| Branch already exists | Generate unique branch name with timestamp |
| SSH key error | Retry with `required_permissions: ["all"]` |
| Not authenticated (gh) | Suggest `gh auth login` |

---

## Constraints

1. **One vulnerability TYPE per run** - Fix all instances of ONE vulnerability type (Code) or ONE dependency issue (SCA)
2. **Minimal changes** - Only modify what's necessary
3. **No new vulnerabilities** - Fixes must be clean (or net improvement for SCA)
4. **Preserve functionality** - Tests must pass
5. **No scope creep** - Don't refactor or "improve" other code
6. **Consistent fixes** - Apply the same fix pattern across all instances (Code)
7. **User confirmation for PR** - Never auto-create PRs

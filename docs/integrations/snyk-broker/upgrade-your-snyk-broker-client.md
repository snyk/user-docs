# Upgrade your Snyk Broker client

Snyk regularly updates the Broker client in order to provide new features, bug fixes and more. Our full list of versions and their release notes are available from GitHub as part of [our Broker project](https://github.com/snyk/broker/releases). We also encourage you to [subscribe to the RSS feed](https://github.com/snyk/broker/releases.atom) for that page to easily receive info about versions as they are released.

When upgrading your broker there may be some new rules added that Snyk requires to function correctly. Therefore, you will need to re-initialize your API allow-list. If you added or removed any rules to [customize your allow-list](https://github.com/snyk/broker#custom-approved-listing-filter) \(for example, to support files greater in size than 1Mb\), you will need to re-apply these changes to the new allow-list.

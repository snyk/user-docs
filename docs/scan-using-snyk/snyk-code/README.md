Snyk is dedicated to the premise that security must be implemented developer-first to meet the speed and scale needs of software-driven businesses.&#x20;

The problem with traditional SAST products is they do not work for developers. They are too slow, with scans that can take several hours, and they historically have had poor accuracy and returned too many false positives. This created hours of wasted time as false alarms were chased down. These problems eroded the developer's trust in the tool, and these products required security expertise to make their output actionable, so developers could remediate the issues they found. Snyk changed all of this.

## Developer-first approach

Snyk Code takes a developer-first approach: embedding [SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/static-application-security-testing/) as part of the development process, enabling developers to build software securely during the coding stage, and not trying to find and fix problems after the code is compiled. Snyk Code works in the IDEs and SCMs where the developers build and review code and provides fast, actionable, and meaningful results to fix issues in real-time.

## Unparalleled accuracy

Generally, SAST tools have been notorious for the false positives they return. Snyk Code uses a semantic analysis AI engine that learns from millions of open-source commits and is paired with the Snyk Security Intelligence database. This creates a continually growing [code security](https://snyk.io/learn/secure-coding-practices/) knowledge base, which reduces false positives to near zero and provides actionable findings that matter.

## Real-time

Speed is _the_ critical factor if you want to support rapid, agile development. Real-time speed allows developers to use Snyk Code from the IDE and during code review in the SCM rather than add a slow and unnecessary extra step at the end of the development process. Snyk Code scans 10-50 times faster than other SAST products, enabling developers to use Snyk Code _while_ they develop rather than _after_ they develop, as a slow and disruptive step in their process.

## Actionable

Although quickly and accurately detecting potential security flaws in the source code is complicated, Snyk believes doing that is not enough. Snyk can only shift left and empower developers if it helps fix the issue and teaches about prevention. Snyk Code applies its security knowledge base to provide fix examples from real-world projects, thus offereing insights on how to fix the discovered issues. In addition, Snyk Code offers curated educational content about every vulnerability to help developers expand their knowledge and reduce issues over time.

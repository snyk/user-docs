# Use Snyk Code IDE

IDE integrations use the fast analysis and response of Snyk Code, allowing you to spot an issue, understand and learn more about it, and fix it while you write the code before checking it in. In this way, you can find possible security flaws in your code as you write it on a line-by-line basis.

## JetBrains IDE plugins

Snyk Code supports the JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ, Webstorm, PyCharm, and more with a plugin that allows you to find and fix issues directly from the IDE:

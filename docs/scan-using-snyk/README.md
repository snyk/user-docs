# Scan using Snyk

You can use Snyk to scan and secure your codebase and cloud infrastructure configurations, taking advantage of the Snyk capabilities in Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and  Infrastructure as Code analysis.

## Snyk Open Source

Find and fix known vulnerabilities and licensing issues in your open-source dependencies.

For more information, see [Snyk Open Source ](../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-snyk-broker/advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/snyk-open-source-scans-sca-of-large-manifest-files-docker-setup.md)and [Open Source Security Explained](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/) on the Security series hub.

## Snyk Code

Scan your codebase for known vulnerabilities and get remediation guidance either inline in your IDE or by importing your code repository to Snyk Web UI.

For more information, see [Snyk Code](./#snyk-code) and [Exploring the advanced technologies behind Snyk Code ](https://snyk.io/blog/advanced-technologies-behind-snyk-code/)on the Snyk blog.

## Snyk Container

Find and automatically fix container and workload vulnerabilities.

For more information, see [Snyk Container](snyk-container/).

## Snyk IaC

Secure cloud infrastructure configurations before and after deployment.

For more information, see [Scan infrastructure](scan-infrastructure/).

## Working with Snyk in your environment

Implement a workflow to secure your code and infrastructure in your environment using the scanning methods provided by Snyk products.

For more information, see [Working with Snyk in your environment](working-with-snyk-in-your-environment/) and [Supported languages and frameworks](../scan-applications/supported-languages-and-frameworks/).

## Run pull request checks

Scan and automatically address potential vulnerabilities when you review pull requests, to prevent security issues in production.

# CLI and IDE

To use CLI and IDE with Snyk Code Local Engine, you need to provide your CSM with your **Snyk Code Local Engine URL**, the URL of the Snyk Code Local Engine running on your premises.\
\
Once your CSM has configured the URL for your org, you can view it from Settings  (![](../../../.gitbook/assets/cog\_icon.png)) --> Snyk Code as shown in the screenshot that follows.

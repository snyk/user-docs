# Application vulnerability in Snyk Container and Snyk Open Source

Snyk Container can detect application vulnerabilities in your container, which seems to overlap Snyk Open Source capabilities.\
\
**In theory**, the results from the Snyk Container application vulnerability feature and Snyk Open Source should be the same, especially if Snyk is building a dependency graph from the same manifest files. \
\
**In practice**, however, the results would vary significantly from ecosystem to ecosystem and depending on how the developer builds the application. An application in the container is a compiled application, so in some ecosystems, Snyk Open Source is able to access a more detailed manifest that results in building a more accurate dependency graph.

* `golang` projects for Snyk Containers: Snyk does not have access to the list of dependencies as in Snyk Open Source. Thus Snyk Container reverse parses binaries, and the result differs slightly from Snyk Open Source.
* `npm` packages as Snyk Containers: Snyk can have access to the list of dependencies. The result should be the same as in Snyk Open Source.
* `java` applications for Snyk Containers: The result will be different because, in Open Source, it is possible to include unmanaged jars as explained in [Scan all unmanaged jar files](../../../../snyk-cli/test-for-vulnerabilities/scan-all-unmanaged-jar-files.md). In Container. the scan traverses all the jars Snyk found in the image, as stated in [Detecting application vulnerabilities in container images](./). Additionally, there are multiple ways to build a jar, and this is affects Snyk Container in finding the dependencies.

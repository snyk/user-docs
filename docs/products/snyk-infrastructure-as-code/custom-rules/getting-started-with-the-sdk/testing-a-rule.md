# Testing a rule

If you've generated the rules using the `template` command, as shown in [Writing a rule](writing-a-rule.md), then you can also benefit from using the testing functionality that comes with the SDK and the generated rules.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You may also write your own testing functionality or modify the one generated by the SDK, as you prefer. However, the instructions in this page would not apply.
{% endhint %}

Assuming you have written your rule based on the previous tutorial, open the `main_test.rego` file generated by the SDK's templating functionality and configure the `fixture` field with the name of the file inside your `rules/my_rule/fixtures/` folder. The templating functionality has created one file per supported format and configured the tests to run against all of them, but you may remove fixture files as you desire.

Create or modify fixture files to store your resources under `rules/my_rule/fixtures`. These files can have any name, so take for example `denied.tf` and `allowed.tf`:

{% hint style="warning" %}
The file can have any name but pay close attention to the file extension. Be especially careful if you want to write a test for a fixture file containing Terraform Plan JSON Output, make sure the name of the file has the file extension `.json.tfplan` so that our testing library can differentiate between plain JSON and Terraform Plan JSON Output.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="rules/my_rule/fixtures/denied.tf" %}
```
resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "denied" {
  cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
  database_name      = "mydb"
  master_username    = "foo"
  master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
  node_type          = "dc1.large"
  cluster_type       = "single-node"
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="rules/my_rule/fixtures/allowed.tf" %}
```
resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "allowed" {
  cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
  database_name      = "mydb"
  master_username    = "foo"
  master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
  node_type          = "dc1.large"
  cluster_type       = "single-node"
  tags {
    owner = "snyk"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

In the `want_msgs` field of the test case, you should add the msg fields of the resources that you expect that your deny rule will evaluate/return, e.g. `["input.resource.aws_redshift_cluster[denied].tags"]`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `want_msgs` field should be an array containing hardcoded values corresponding to the computed `msg` field in the appropriate Rego rule.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="rules/my_rule/main_test.rego" %}
```
package rules

import data.lib
import data.lib.testing

test_my_rule {
	# array containing test cases where the rule is allowed
	allowed_test_cases := [{
		"want_msgs": [],
		"fixture": "allowed.tf",
	}]
	# array containing cases where the rule is denied
	denied_test_cases := [{
		"want_msgs": ["input.resource.aws_redshift_cluster[denied].tags"],
		"fixture": "denied.tf",
	}]
	test_cases := array.concat(allowed_test_cases, denied_test_cases)
	testing.evaluate_test_cases("my_rule", "./rules/my_rule/fixtures", test_cases)
}
```
{% endcode %}

To run all tests, run the following command:

```
 snyk-iac-rules test
```

If your tests pass successfully, you will see an output similar to the following, assuming you have three different rules in your `rules/` folder:

```
PASS: 3/3
```

However, if any of them fail, you will see an output similar to the following:

```
data.rules.test_my_rule: FAIL (1.12234ms)
FAIL: 2/3
```

If you have more than one rule in your `rule/`, folder you can target a specific test by running the following command:

```
snyk-iac-rules test --run test_my_rule
```

This will output:

```
Executing Rego test cases...
data.rules.test_my_rule: FAIL (1.040468ms)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAIL: 1/1
```

If you need more details about it, add the `--explain notes` option:

```
 snyk-iac-rules test --run test_my_rule --explain notes
```

This will output more details to debug the failed test.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have more than your generated rules in the current folder ,consider using the  `--ignore` flag to exclude the folders and files irrelevant to testing (make sure to not exclude `lib/` and `rules` if you used the `template` command). This can speed up the tests and also avoids running into problems where Rego is trying to evaluate non-Rego files.

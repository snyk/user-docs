# Initial Setup

In this module, we'll use a simple, representative pipeline to build and deploy a container image in Bitbucket Pipelines. This type of operation emulates some of the steps development teams use in their daily CI/CD pipelines and how you can augment your pipeline tasks with Snyk. You'll need to configure some items in Bitbucket and AWS for this part of the workshop.

The sequence we follow will require navigation between screens, because of the need to copy information from one place to another. We'll guide you in that process by identifying the information you need.

* Configure AWS ECR
* Enable Bitbucket Pipelines
* Add repository variables

We'll address each in the next sections.

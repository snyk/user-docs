#### **Silver Success offering description**&#x20;

**Technical Success Manager:** Named Technical Resource assigned to your account to guide your onboarding and support your Snyk implementation as it grows and evolves.

**Dedicated TSM Hours:** Dedicated TSM hours refer to the amount of time the Named Technical Resources will spend working on the account, regardless of whether that time is with the Customer. For instance, if the Customer has questions that a TSM needs to research, the time spent researching is considered part of the allocated hours.

The dedicated hours are a guideline intended to set expectations, rather than a contractual term. Hours do not roll over. If the Customer needs more time one week, and less the next, the TSM will be flexible and adherent.

The Silver Success offering includes, on average, up to two (2) dedicated TSM hours per week.

**Guided onboarding:** Snyk will guide the Customer through onboarding, ensuring the Customer is enabled with the following:

* Effective account configuration (including Org structure, SSO setup, and so on)
* Project import strategy
* Remediation triage strategy

Customer onboarding needs vary depending on the solutions purchased.

**Success planning:** Snyk will provide a template to assist the Customer with identifying goals and creating their success plan. The Customer is responsible for tracking and executing their plan.

**Business review cadence:** The Technical Success Manager will deliver a business review with the Customer and Snyk account team members twice a year.

**Private Slack channel:** Direct engagement over Slack with your Technical Account team to encourage collaboration.

#### **Silver Support**&#x20;

The Silver Success Plan includes Silver Support.&#x20;

**Pooled Technical Support:** Support tickets are handled and triaged by a pool of Technical Support Engineers.

**24x7 support hours:** Snyk Technical Support Engineers actively respond to tickets 24 hours a day, Monday to Friday. For urgent customer issues outside of 24x5, Snyk provides a 24-hour support telephone number (+1-844-835-8167). This is served by a telephone answering service, which routes the request to Snyk on-call engineers.

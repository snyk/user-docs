# Snyk Jumpstart Services Description

## Overview of Snyk Jumpstart

A Snyk Consultant will provide services to help the Customer accelerate its setup of Snyk products through assisted account configuration (the “Jumpstart Services”). The engagement will consist of knowledge transfer, paired with configuration guidance for your team. 

The objective is a working setup of Snyk and a Customer team that is well-prepared to continue its application security efforts.

**Jumpstart is recommended for**:

* Teams needing assistance with the setup of Snyk products
* Teams who are new to Snyk and have limited experience with security scanning
* Self-starters who are comfortable with extending and maintaining Snyk on their own, post-engagement

Note that the Jumpstart Services will be delivered only for the Snyk Applications purchased on an Order Form at the same time as this service.

## Pre-engagement planning and preparation

A pre-engagement call will be held before the start of the Jumpstart Services listed herein, to ensure the Customer understands the prerequisites required for engagement start, along with the deliverables to be completed during the engagement timeframe. Customer [prerequisites](snyk-jumpstart-customer-prerequisites.md), including resources, availability, and deliverables for each product module, will be reviewed and confirmed. The Customer acknowledges that complying with these prerequisites is its sole responsibility, and Snyk will not be responsible for any delays or failure to deliver the Jumpstart Services based on the Customer’s failure to meet these prerequisites.

* Configure one application context provider integration
* Configure asset policies. The Snyk Consultant will guide the Customer through the setup and configuration of asset policies, such as:
  * Classify assets visible to Snyk
  * Identify coverage gaps based on purchased Snyk products
  * Notify by email when a criteria (e.g. coverage gap or new repo detected) is met

#### Walkthrough of coverage and visibility use cases in Snyk Essentials

## Timeline for Snyk Jumpstart delivery

Snyk Jumpstart delivery is a 60-day engagement that begins with the Jumpstart Kickoff call. 

For customers starting their journey with Snyk, Jumpstart includes initial Platform Configuration and each product module that has been purchased.

If the Jumpstart project is for an existing Snyk customer, the Platform Configuration content is adjusted to reflect this, with the Snyk consultant providing a ‘healthcheck’ review of the existing configuration, before working through the onboarding of new features or products. 

## Additional terms

The fees for this project will be a fixed price. Services will be invoiced in full at the time of purchase and are non-refundable.&#x20;

Upon purchase, the Snyk implementation team will coordinate a pre-engagement call at a time that works for both parties. Note that Jumpstart services expire 120 days after our consultant's first outreach, regardless of customer engagement. All Jumpstart Services automatically conclude either upon completion or eight weeks following the kick-off call, whichever occurs first.

Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, a) services must be scheduled as agreed during the pre-engagement call; b) product modules will be delivered consecutively; and c) all services will occur during normal business hours.&#x20;

All services will be performed remotely. Any onsite time requires Snyk’s prior consent and will be subject to additional fees and expenses to be agreed in advance.

## Key assumptions

The following assumptions are reflected in the services outlined in this Jumpstart Services description:

1. All services will be performed remotely using video conferencing software such as Zoom.&#x20;
2. The Customer must provide prompt feedback on all deliverables.
3. The Customer will appoint one subject matter expert who will be the point of contact for the Jumpstart Services. This subject matter expert must be available to work remotely with the Snyk Consultant for the entirety of the engagement.
4. The Customer will provide Snyk with documentation and access to subject matter experts for non-Snyk systems and software if required within the scope of the engagement.
5. The Customer will have identified key personnel prior to the beginning of the engagement.
6. Services will be scheduled and delivered during Snyk’s normal business hours: 8 am to 5 pm local time zone Monday through Friday (Sunday through Thursday where applicable based on the region of the assigned Snyk Consultant).
7. The Customer will provide prompt access to all systems and resources that Snyk will need in order to complete the work.&#x20;
8. Snyk does not provide support for third-party software that is used as part of the Snyk solution, such as version control systems, repository management, trouble ticketing systems, packaging, and other software that is not part of the Snyk stack.&#x20;
9. If a Broker is required, the Customer will have all system requirements before services start.
10. All services and communications will be conducted in English.

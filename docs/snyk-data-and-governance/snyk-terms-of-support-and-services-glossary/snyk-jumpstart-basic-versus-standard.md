## Common components&#x20;

Both packages cover the foundational setup for Open Source, Code, Container, and IaC for up to 50 targets per module:

* **Initial setup**: Pre-engagement planning and platform configuration.
* **Integrations**: One Group-level SCM integration, such as GitHub or GitLab, and Jira or Slack alerts.
* **Automation**: Configuration of a single CI/CD pipeline.
* **Prioritization**: Guidance on interpreting scan results and using **Asset Inventory** to identify coverage gaps.

## Success criteria

* **Dedicated SME**: Appoint a single point of contact for the duration of the engagement.
* **Timeline**: Services expire if not use within the allotted time (60 days for Basic, 120 days for Standard).
* **Delivery**: Snyk delivers all sessions remotely and consecutively during normal business hours.

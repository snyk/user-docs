## 보안 및 취약점 데이터

Snyk Intel Vulnerability Database라고도 하는 Snyk의 [보안 인텔리전스 데이터베이스](https://snyk.io/snyk-intelligence-security/)는 maintained by a dedicated research team that combines public sources, contributions from the developer community, proprietary research, and machine learning to continuously adapt to the changing and expanding nature of security threats.

## Snyk CLI

You can use the Snyk CLI (Command Line Interface) to scan and monitor on your local machine, and integrate it into your pipeline. You can use the Snyk CLI to scan your applications, containers, and infrastructure as code for security vulnerabilities. You can install the CLI via npm, Homebrew, Scoop, or manually.

[Get started with the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/guides-for-our-cli/getting-started-with-the-cli).

## Snyk API

Snyk’s extensibility and API enable developers to tune Snyk’s security automation to their specific workflows, ensuring both developer experience and consistent platform governance.

# Glossary

## A

### Advisor

See [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/).

## B

### Base image

The parent image used to construct a container image, usually defined in the FROM directive in a Dockerfile. Base images themselves can be constructed from other base images.

### Broker

See [Snyk Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-broker).

### Build System

A system that takes the source code and builds the deployable application (such as a container).

## C

### CI / CD

Continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD) and continuous deployment (CD) together comprise an SDLC model, guiding developers to automate development and delivery of small, frequent changes. This ensures all team members have access to the latest code base and can ensure the compatibility of committed code during development.

### CLI

Command Line Interface. See [Snyk CLI](glossary.md#snyk-cli).

### Cloud Native Application Security

Implementing security throughout the CI/CD pipeline, automating security embedding in microservices and maximizing repetition to reduce the introduction of vulnerabilities. Snyk provides a comprehensive [CNAS platform](https://snyk.io/product/cloud-native-application-security/).

### Container

Containers allow you to package applications and their dependencies together, to be deployed as a single runnable unit. A container is an abstraction provided by the operating system kernel, that allows a process to be isolated from other processes running on the system. Also see [Snyk Container.](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360017682058-Snyk-Glossary#SnykContainer)

### Container engine

For users, an application which takes a container image and turns it into a running container. Container engines typically interface with container registries, and run containers. Examples of container engines include Docker, CRI-O or LXC.

### Container image

One or more files which, when instantiated by a container engine or runtime, provide a running container. Images are the packaging and distribution format for containers.

### Container registry

A server which provides a mechanism to store and retrieve container images.

### CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. A widely-used identifier for a well-known vulnerability.

### CVSS

## D

### DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing. An application that you can point at a site or service; it then typically profiles the site or service, then examines the output and behaviour to uncover security vulnerabilities. Also see [SAST](glossary.md#sast).

### Dependency

When your application uses another package, this other package becomes a dependency to your own software.

* A direct dependency is a package you include in your own project.
* An indirect dependency (also known as a deep, chained, or transitive dependency), is a package that is used by one of your direct dependencies.

### Dependency tree

### Dockerfile

A text file format used to build container images using Docker. The Dockerfile contains all the commands needed to construct the final image, including specifying the parent base image.

## E

### Exploit

A demonstration of how a vulnerability can be taken advantage of. When an exploit is widely published, it is commonly referred to as an exploit in the wild.

### Exploit Maturity

A measure of how practical an exploit for a vulnerability is, based on whether the exploit is in the wild, and how "helpful" the exploit is to attackers. See [Evaluating and prioritizing vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/evaluating-and-prioritizing-vulnerabilities).

## F

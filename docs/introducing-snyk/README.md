# Introducing Snyk

## What is Snyk?

Snyk is a platform allowing you to scan, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in your own code, open source dependencies, container images, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations.

### Snykâ€™s developer-first approach

Developers now assemble applications with a combination of proprietary and open source code, run that code in containers, and then deploy with infrastructure as code configurations with technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform.

A good security process secures each of these components where they are built and maintained. Snyk integrates into DevOps processes to work with the developers in the methods they prefer to work while following and supporting industry best practices. Snyk integrates directly into your IDEs, workflows, and automation pipelines to add security expertise to your toolkit.

#### Using Snyk in your workflow:

* **Secure your code**: use [Snyk Open Source](../products/snyk-open-source/) to fix vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies, and [Snyk Code](../products/snyk-code/) to fix vulnerabilities in your source code.
* **Secure your environments**: use [Snyk Container](../products/snyk-container/) to fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes workloads, and [Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/) to fix misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Azure templates.

### Ways to run Snyk

Snyk runs in the following environments:

* In the browser as [Snyk Web UI](../snyk-web-ui/).
* In your local Command Line Interface (or in your pipeline) with the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli).
* In various [IDE plugins](../ide-tools/) that embed Snyk in your local dev environment.
* In the [Snyk API](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/categories/360000665657-Snyk-API) (Application Programming Interface).

See [Snyk products and environments](snyk-products-and-environments.md) for more details.

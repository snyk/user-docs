# Authentication for third-party tools

When you work with Snyk from within any third-party tool, Snyk requires authentication in order to initiate its processes.

Snyk offers API tokens to enable integrations with third-party developer tools. You can authenticate through your personal account using your personal token or through a [service account](service-accounts/) using the token associated with that account. When you authenticate through a service account, you do not use any personal token.

{% hint style="info" %}
For authentication purposes, the third-party identity providers **do not require access to your repositories**, only your email address.
{% endhint %}

## Supported identity providers

You can use one of the following identity providers for authentication with Snyk::

* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* Google
* Azure AD
* Docker ID
* Single Sign-On (SSO): available with Enterprise plans.\
  See [Setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication](using-single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication/).

{% hint style="info" %}
For additional instructions, see the integrations pages for [Git repositories (SCMs)](../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Logging in with a different provider from the one you registered with when you first created your Snyk account will create a separate new Snyk account.
{% endhint %}

## **How to authenticate for a third-party tool using your personal token**

1. Visit [your Snyk account](https://app.snyk.io/account).
2. Navigate to **General Account Settings** and copy your token.
3. In the token field, **click to show** and then select and copy your API token.
4. In the third-party interface, configure your integration by pasting your Snyk token when prompted.

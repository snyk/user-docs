# Install and configure Snyk Broker

## How to use Snyk Broker

Snyk Broker is an open-source tool that acts as a proxy between Snyk and special integrations, providing for access by [snyk.io](http://snyk.io/) to scan code in repositories that are not internet-reachable and return results to you. SCM integrations with Broker support Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code, Snyk Container (Dockerfile), and Snyk IaC. For details, see [Integrations with Snyk Broker](../../#integrations-with-snyk-broker).

For comprehensive information about Snyk Broker, including how it works, how to deploy it, commit signing, upgrading, and troubleshooting, see the full [Snyk Broker user documentation](../../).

{% hint style="info" %}
[Broker version 4.205.1](https://github.com/snyk/broker/blob/cb4f89e05eb42605f076321b952cdb7e57bf4111/config.default.json#L8) has been [released](https://updates.snyk.io). In this version, all `ACCEPT` rule flags will be enabled by default. This reduces needed configuration. If you do not want a specific `ACCEPT` rule flag to be enabled, you can opt out of the default `ACCEPT` all behavior by adding `ACCEPT_=false` to your Broker client configuration.

Alternatively, you can use the binaries available for [each Github release](https://github.com/snyk/broker/releases). However, this approach falls outside of Snyk product support and is made available only for specific use cases where containers cannot be used. The containerized version is strongly recommended.

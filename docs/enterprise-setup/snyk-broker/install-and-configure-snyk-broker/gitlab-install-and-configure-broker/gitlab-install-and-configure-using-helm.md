Notes for installation using Helm

For the `gitlab` value, do not include `https://.`

`brokerToken` is a Helm variable that feeds into and sets the `BROKER_TOKEN` environment variable. It is the Helm way to pass the token.

`ACCEPT_CODE` is [set to true by default](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm/blob/465d4ef279755fa5c9507975a88348bab04c2264/charts/snyk-broker/templates/broker\_deployment.yaml#L383) in the chart, as is [ACCEPT\_IAC](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm/blob/465d4ef279755fa5c9507975a88348bab04c2264/charts/snyk-broker/templates/broker\_deployment.yaml#L386C23-L386C43). You can disable them if needed using `disableAutoAcceptRules=true`, but otherwise, these are enabled.

# Azure Repos - install and configure using Docker

Follow the instructions on this page to set up Snyk Azure Repos with Snyk Broker. This integration is useful to ensure a secure connection with your on-premise or cloud Azure Repos deployment.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Release status**\
Snyk Azure Repos are available only for Azure DevOps/TFS 2020 or above.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Prerequisites**\
Ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.

You need Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
{% endhint %}

## Configure Broker to be used with Azure Repos

To use the Broker Client with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), **run** `docker pull snyk/broker:azure-repos`. Refer to [Azure Repos - environment variables for Snyk Broker](azure-repos-environment-variables-for-snyk-broker.md) for definitions of the environment variables.

**If necessary,** go to the [Advanced configuration page](../advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/) and **make any configuration changes** needed, such as providing the CA (Certificate Authority) to the Broker Client configuration if the Azure Repos instance is using a private certificate, and setting up [proxy support](../advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/proxy-support-with-docker.md).

## Docker run command to set up a Broker Client for Azure Repos

**Copy the following command** to set up a fully configured Broker Client to analyze Open Source, IaC, Container, Code files (with the Code Agent), and Snyk AppRisk information. Enable [Snyk AppRisk](../../../../manage-risk/snyk-apprisk/) to identify your application assets, monitor them, and prioritize the risks.

```bash
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=<secret-broker-token> \
           -e AZURE_REPOS_TOKEN=<secret-azure-token> \
           -e AZURE_REPOS_ORG=<org-name> \
           -e AZURE_REPOS_HOST=<your.azure-server.domain.com (no http/s)> \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=<http://broker.url.example:8000 (dns/IP:port)> \
           -e ACCEPT_IAC=tf,yaml,yml,json,tpl \
           -e ACCEPT_CODE=true \
           -e ACCEPT_APPRISK=true \
       snyk/broker:azure-repos
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk AppRisk is set by default to **`false`**. Enable it by setting the flag to **`true`**.
{% endhint %}

As an alternative to using the Docker run command, you can use a derived Docker image to set up the Broker Client integration. See [Derived Docker images](../derived-docker-images-for-broker-client-integrations-and-container-registry-agent.md) for the environment variables to override for the Azure Repos integration.

## Start the Broker Client container and verify the connection with Azure Repos

Paste the Broker Client configuration to start the Broker Client container.

Once the container is up, the Azure Repos Integrations page shows the connection to Azure Repos and you can `Add Projects.`

## Basic troubleshooting for Broker with Azure Repos

* Run `docker logs <container id>` to look for any errors, where `container id` is the Azure Repos Broker container ID.
* Ensure relevant ports are exposed to Azure Repos.
* Make sure that file permissions for the local path to the `accept.json` file, as well as the `accept.json` file itself, are correct and accessible.

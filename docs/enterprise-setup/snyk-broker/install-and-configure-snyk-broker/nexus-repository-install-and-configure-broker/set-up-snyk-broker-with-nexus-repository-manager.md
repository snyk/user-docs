# Nexus Repository - install and configure using Docker

Follow the instructions on this page to set up Nexus Repository Manager with Snyk Broker. This integration is useful to ensure a secure connection with your on-premise Nexus Respository Manager deployment.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Release status**&#x20;

Integration with Nexus Repository Manager is available only for Enterprise plans.

See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Prerequisites**\
Ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token or generate it from the Snyk Web UI.

You need Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers.\
Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.

{% hint style="info" %}
For information about non-brokered integration with Nexus Repository Manager including supported environments and versions and user permissions, see [Nexus Repository Manager setup](../../../../integrate-with-snyk/package-repository-integrations/nexus-repository-manager-connection-setup/).

## Obtain Broker token for Nexus integration

1. Go to settings <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/cog_icon.png" alt="Settings icon" data-size="line"> > **Integrations > Package Repositories > Nexus**
2. Verify that you see the screen to configure Nexus.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not see the **Snyk Broker** switch, you do not have the necessary permissions and can only add a publicly accessible instance.

Submit a request to [Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you want to add a private registry.
{% endhint %}

When you have permissions to add a private registry, continue with the instructions to [generate a Broker token from the Web UI](set-up-snyk-broker-with-nexus-repository-manager.md#generate-a-broker-token-from-the-web-ui).

## Generate a Broker token from the Web UI

1. In the Nexus integration settings, move the **Snyk Broker on/off** switch to **on** to display a form for generating a Broker token.
2. Select **Generate and Save.**
3. Copy the token that was generated to use when you set up the Broker Client.

## Configure Broker to be used for Nexus plugins

### Docker pull for Nexus 3 and Nexus 2 configuration

To use the Broker client with a Nexus 3 deployment, **run** `docker pull snyk/broker:nexus`.

To use the Broker client with a Nexus 2 deployment, **run** `docker pull snyk/broker:nexus2`.

For definitions of the environment variables, see [Nexus Repository - environment variables for Snyk Broker](nexus-repository-environment-variables-for-snyk-broker.md).

### Docker run commands to set up Broker Client for Nexus 3 and Nexus 2 integrations

**Copy the following command** to set up a fully configured Broker Client to use with Nexus 3. You can run the Docker container by providing the relevant configuration:

```console
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 7341:7341 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e BASE_NEXUS_URL=https://[<user>:<pass>@]<your.nexus.hostname> \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_URL=https://<your.nexus.hostname>/service/rest/v1/status[/check] \
           -e RES_BODY_URL_SUB=https://<your.nexus.hostname>/repository \
       snyk/broker:nexus
```

**Copy the following command** to set up a fully configured Broker Client to use with Nexus 2. You can run the Docker container by providing the relevant configuration:

```
docker run --restart=always \
  -p 7341:7341 \
  -e BROKER_TOKEN=<secret-broker-token> \
  -e BASE_NEXUS_URL=https://[username:password]@acme.com \
  -e RES_BODY_URL_SUB=https://acme.com/nexus/content/(groups|repositories) \ 
  snyk/broker:nexus2
```

As an **alternative to using the Docker run command**, you can use a derived Docker image to set up the Broker Client integration. See [Derived Docker images](../derived-docker-images-for-broker-client-integrations-and-container-registry-agent.md) for the environment variables to override for the Nexus3 integration.

## Start the Broker Client container and verify the connection with Nexus Repository Manager

Paste the Broker Client configuration to start the Broker Client container.

Check connection status by making a request to the Broker Client `/systemcheck` endpoint.

Example: `curl http://172.17.0.2:7341/systemcheck`

You see success output in the following form:

`{"brokerClientValidationUrl":"https://acme.com/service/rest/v1/status","brokerClientValidationMethod":"GET","brokerClientValidationTimeoutMs":5000,"brokerClientValidationUrlStatusCode":200,"ok":true}`

Or failure output in the following form:

`{"brokerClientValidationUrl":"https://acme.com/service/rest/v1/status","brokerClientValidationMethod":"GET","brokerClientValidationTimeoutMs":5000,"ok":false,"error":"ETIMEDOUT"}`

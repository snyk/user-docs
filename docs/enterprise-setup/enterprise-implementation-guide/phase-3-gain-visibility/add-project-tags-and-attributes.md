# Add Project tags and attributes

After importing your projects, you can add metadata to your Projects using [Project Attributes](../../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md) or [Project Tags](../../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-tags.md). This makes it easier to filter and report on specific subsets of your Organization.

For example, if you add both Project Attributes and a Tag of `Team:Unicorn` to all of your Projects that a specific Dev Team owns, you can easily generate a report of ‘frontend critical vulnerabilities in production that team Unicorn owns’.&#x20;

Attributes and Tags are also useful features that can be used to configure [Project Collections or Project Views](../../../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-collections-groupings/), making it easier for you to view Projects in a grouping that makes sense to you.

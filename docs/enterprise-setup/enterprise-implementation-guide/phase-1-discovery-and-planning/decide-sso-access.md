# Decide SSO access

### Deciding Single Sign-On (SSO) Settings

For more information on SSO, see [Using Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication](../../using-single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication/)&#x20;

While it's common for the initial pilot/trial team to use personal authentication, before rolling Snyk out to users, you should implement SSO, including

* Creating appropriate SSO accounts created and promoted to Administrator
* Removing the personal profiles from Snyk before rolling it out to a wider group.

### SSO Provisioning Options

When setting up access for new users in your company, there are several approaches to consider that determine the user experience and access. In this step you need to consider Open To All or Require an Invite, and if Custom Mapping is desired.

* Review [Choose a Provisioning Option](../../using-single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication/choose-a-provisioning-option.md)

**Custom Mapping**\
It is available exclusively with [paid services](https://docs.snyk.io/more-info/snyk-terms-of-support-and-services-glossary). This feature allows you to provision user accounts with customized rules, tailoring access and roles based on specific needs. Keep in mind that this feature may involve more complex configuration and setup, and it's recommended for organizations with more advanced access management requirements.\

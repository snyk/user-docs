## General pre-rollout questions

Before starting rollout, here are some initial questions you can ask, to assist in planning - this is an alternative way of deciding your rollout planning process.

#### Who's involved?

* Who will manage and oversee the project?
* Who will champion Snyk?
* Who will be the Group Administrator?

#### What are your goals?

* Why did you choose Snyk?&#x20;
* Why are you implementing it now?

#### How will your users use Snyk?&#x20;

How will you provision users, and integrate Snyk with your platforms?

* Who will need access to Snyk?&#x20;
* What will they need access to?&#x20;
* Will access be restricted to certain projects?
* Who can grant Snyk access to platforms like SSO and Git Repositories?

#### How will you structure your account?

* How will you group projects?
  * By developer teams?&#x20;
  * By product?&#x20;
  * By business unit?
* If by developer teams, are there some teams that would need access to the same projects? If yes, think about a different structure to avoid confusion.
* How many [Snyk Organizations](../../../snyk-admin/manage-groups-and-organizations/whats-a-snyk-organization.md) do you need?&#x20;

#### How will you measure success?&#x20;

* What KPIs will be tracked?
* How will you know you’re making progress?
* Are there key development projects that progress tracking should be aligned with, or at least included to measure progress against?

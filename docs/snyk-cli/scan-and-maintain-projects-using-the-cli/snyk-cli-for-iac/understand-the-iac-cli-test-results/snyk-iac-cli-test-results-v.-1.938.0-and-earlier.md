# Snyk IaC CLI test results (v. 1.938.0 and earlier)

{% hint style="info" %}
The instructions in this section apply to any file format supported by Snyk Infrastructure as Code, including Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation, and ARM.
{% endhint %}

Snyk analyzes your configuration file for issues and provides additional information on the issues discovered that can help you resolve them.

For example, when scanning a Terraform file, run the following command:

```
snyk iac test aws_api_gateway_stage_logging.tf
```

The results from running this command follow:

The results include a list of issues sorted by severity, where each issue reported includes the following details:&#x20;

* **Heading** - the issue that was detected, the severity of that issue, and the Snyk Policy ID for that particular issue.
* **Location** - the property path within the configuration file where the issue was identified. See the example that follows for more details.

The path of this issue is specified as follows:

```
resource > aws_api_gateway_stage[denied] > access_log_settings
```

The following example represents the content of the `aws_api_gateway_stage` block, called "**denied**", which lacks the `access_log_settings` field.

{% code title="aws_api_gateway_stage_logging.tf" %}
```
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "denied" {
  xray_tracing_enabled = true
}
```
{% endcode %}

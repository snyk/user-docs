# Scan source code with Snyk Code using the CLI

Snyk Code enables you to test the source code of your repositories using the Snyk CLI.

When testing your repository code via the CLI, you can:

* [Test the repository directly from its root folder](scan-source-code-with-snyk-code-using-the-cli.md#testing-a-repository-from-its-root-folder).
* [Test the repository from another location](scan-source-code-with-snyk-code-using-the-cli.md#testing-a-repository-from-a-different-location).

When you test a folder, all its sub-folders and files are also tested.

To exclude certain directories or files from the Snyk Code CLI test, you can use the following means:

* The  `snyk ignore --file-path` command. See [Excluding directories and files from the Snyk Code test](exclude-directories-and-files-from-snyk-code-cli-tests.md).
* Manually creating a `.snyk` file in the tested folder. See [Excluding directories and files from the import process](../../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/import-repository-to-snyk/excluding-directories-and-files-from-the-import-process.md).

## **Testing a repository from its root folder**

To test the current repository folder, in the terminal, enter the following:

```
snyk code test
```

No additional options are required for using the `snyk code test` command to test a repository from its root folder.

Snyk Code tests the current folder and displays the [test results](broken-reference) in the terminal.

For example, to test the `snyk-goof` repository from its root folder, first change the directory to the root folder of the repository. Then enter:

```
snyk code test
```

Snyk Code tests the `snyk-goof` repository, and displays the vulnerability issues that were discovered:

## **Testing a repository from a different location**

To test a repository from another folder, in the terminal, enter the following:

```
snyk code test <path/to/folder>
```

The  `path/to/folder` is the full path of the repository you want to test using Snyk Code via the CLI.

For example, to test the **snyk-goof** repository from another directory, enter:

```
snyk code test /Users/username/Documents/Repositories/snyk-goof
```

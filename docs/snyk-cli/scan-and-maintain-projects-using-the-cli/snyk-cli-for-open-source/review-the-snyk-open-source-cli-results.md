* The number of direct and transitive dependencies scanned
* Total number of issues found across one or more paths
* The number of paths through which vulnerable dependencies are introduced

## **List of vulnerability issues detected by Snyk Open Source**

The list of issues discovered in the Snyk Open Source test includes the following sections.

### **Issues to fix by upgrading**

These are issues that can be fixed by upgrading a direct dependencies version. They contain the following information:

* Which dependency to upgrade to resolve the issue
* The issue type
* The [severity rating](../../../scan-with-snyk/find-and-manage-priority-issues/severity-levels.md) for the issue
* A link to the related issue in the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/)
* The dependency through which this vulnerability is introduced and its path

### **Issues with no direct upgrade or patch**

These are issues that cannot be resolved by upgrading a direct dependency. They contain the same information as the issues to fix by upgrading, with versions in which the vulnerability could be fixed if the dependency were upgradeable.

### License Issues

License issues are determined by the [license policy](../../../scan-with-snyk/policies/license-policies/) of your Snyk Organization. License issues  contain the following information:

* Type of license
* License severity as determined by the license policy of your Snyk Organization
* Link to the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), which provides more information about the license
* Dependency path through which this license is introduced

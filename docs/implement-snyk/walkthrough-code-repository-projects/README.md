# Walkthrough: Code Repository Projects

This walkthrough shows how to use Snyk to scan, manage, and fix application vulnerabilities in your Git-based code repository using the Snyk Web UI.

This walkthrough shows importing Projects from a GitHub repository. Snyk also supports other common Git-based repositories, such as GitLab and Azure, and items from all these repositories can be added to be scanned. See [Git repository integrations](../../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/) for details.

## Prerequisites for completing this walkthrough

This walkthrough assumes that you have followed the initial setup steps as described in the [Quickstart](broken-reference) documentation: [create a Snyk account](broken-reference), [set up an integration](broken-reference) with a Git repo, and [import a Project](broken-reference) containing items for scanning.

## First step: view your Projects

Start by [viewing your first Snyk Project](view-your-first-snyk-projects.md).

# Invite Users

Click **Members** and invite your team members, applying the role alignments decided in Phase 1 for each member.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Inviting members is generally suggested after importing your Projects. You may bring in a few initial members to start and then do a wider rollout. This can be done at any time as part of stages four and five. It is strongly recommended to communicate what is expected prior to the actual invitation and then communicate throughout the various stages as pull request checks are turned on, pipelines enabled, and as policies/practices change.

# Determine member roles

## Default  roles

A key consideration when setting up Snyk is determining which member roles to align with your needs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The default member roles in Snyk use a fixed set of permissions that cannot be changed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The following are the default member roles:

* **Org Admin**: Typically assigned to team leads. Users with this role can add/delete Projects, override Snyk checks, and provision members. It is common to assign this to team leads, admins, and security team members.&#x20;
* **Org Collaborator**: This is the default role in Snyk used for developers. This role is ideal for small teams or for a very developer-first organizational approach.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need more granularity in roles/permissions, consider upgrading to Snyk Enterprise Plan to access Custom Roles and SSO functionality.

# Plan for success

## Determine success metrics with Snyk

Implementing Snyk provides an opportunity to enhance your application security. But how do you know if you're getting the most out of it? Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential measurements that track Snyk's impact and help guide your security journey.

KPIs give you valuable insights by monitoring key metrics at each adoption phase - from raising awareness to preventing new issues. They help you:

* Assess progress toward security goals
* Identify areas needing improvement
* Demonstrate Snyk's value to stakeholders

Tracking metrics aligned to each stage provides tangible insights into what's working well and where improvements may be needed. KPIs help optimize your use of Snyk and progress your application security program.

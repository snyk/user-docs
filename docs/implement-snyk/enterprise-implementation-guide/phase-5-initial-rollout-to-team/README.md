# Phase 5: Initial rollout to team

After the initial onboarding of Projects and potentially triaging the initial results, you can invite your initial stakeholder groups, allowing them to explore Snyk tools and add Snyk to their day-to-day processes.

Adding Snyk can include:

* Fixing issues and retesting.
* Including in development pipelines using CI/CD integrations and passive monitoring.
* Creating tickets and configuring additional integrations such as Jira.

As the team finalizes how Snyk would best fit into their processes, the wider team can be notified and start using Snyk at scale.

## Snyk Learn Security Education

[Snyk Learn Security Education](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/security-education/?type=security-education) teaches developers how to stay secure with interactive lessons exploring vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems. The modules can be filtered by ecosystem and contain information and guidance on fixing common vulnerability types, such as **NoSQL injection attack** and **Server-side request forgery**.

These lessons are designed to improve your developersâ€™ security knowledge in a broad context, rather than being focused specifically on Snyk products or the remediation advice provided by Snyk. This means they can serve as a great introduction to developer security for less experienced teams in this area.

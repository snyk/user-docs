# Decide SSO access

## Deciding Single Sign-On (SSO) settings

For more information on SSO, see [Using Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication](../../../enterprise-setup/using-single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication/)&#x20;

While it is common for the initial pilot or trial team to use personal authentication, before rolling Snyk out to users, you should implement SSO, including the following:

* Creating appropriate SSO accounts and promoting those accounts to Administrator
* Removing the personal accounts from Snyk before rolling it out to a wider group.

## SSO provisioning options

When you are setting up access for new users in your company, there are several approaches to consider that determine the user experience and access. In this step, consider **Open To All** or **Require an Invite**, and if **Custom Mapping** is desired.

For more information, see [Choose a Provisioning Option](../../../enterprise-setup/using-single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication/choose-a-provisioning-option.md)

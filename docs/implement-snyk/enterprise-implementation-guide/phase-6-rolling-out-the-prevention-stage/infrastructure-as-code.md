# Infrastructure as Code

For Snyk IaC, you may choose to integrate with [Terraform Cloud](../../../integrate-with-snyk/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/terraform-cloud-integration-for-snyk-iac-using-run-tasks/how-to-use-the-terraform-cloud-integration-for-iac.md) to run `snyk iac test` as part of a run workflow, in addition to scanning Terraform and YAML files that are included as part of your source control repositories.

See [Snyk CLI for IaC](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/) for instructions on how to implement Snyk by aC type in the Snyk CLI.

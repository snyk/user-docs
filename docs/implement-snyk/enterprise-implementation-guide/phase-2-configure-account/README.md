# Phase 2: Configure account

After you finish [Phase 1: Discovery and planning](../phase-1-discovery-and-planning/), the next step is configuration.

The following sections suggest initial settings to incorporate in your first Organization or to use in a template Organization that you can copy as you build out your environment.

As part of this configuration, you will want to do the following:

* [Configure SSO](configure-sso.md)
* [Configure Organizations](set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/), including [setting up integrations](set-visibility-and-configure-an-organization-template/configure-integrations.md)
* [Configure license and security policies](apply-security-and-license-policies.md)

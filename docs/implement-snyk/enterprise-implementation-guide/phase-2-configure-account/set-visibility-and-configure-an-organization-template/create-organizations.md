# Create Organizations

You can use the [API-Import-Tool](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/other-tools/tool-snyk-api-import/creating-orgs-in-snyk) and create organizations accordingly.

See the [Snyk Account Structure](https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/groups-and-organizations/) lesson and the [Manage Organizations](../../../../snyk-admin/manage-groups-and-organizations/manage-organizations.md) documentation for how to create Organizations manually.

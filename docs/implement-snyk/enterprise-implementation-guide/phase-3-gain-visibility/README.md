# Phase 3: Gain visibility

When the [Account configuration](../phase-2-configure-account/) phase is complete, you can import your repositories to scan your applications.

When importing your repositories, Snyk scans the contents to find all supported files and to create these in Snyk as Projects, for example, open-source manifest files, code files, IaC configuration files, and so on. See [Import Projects](import-projects.md).

You may optionally add Project Tags or Attributes, which can be useful to filter and organize your Projects when creating collections, views, or reporting. See [Add Project tags and attributes](add-project-tags-and-attributes.md).

# Regional hosting and data residency

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Release status**&#x20;

Regional hosting and data residency are available only for Enterprise plans.

See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans).
{% endhint %}

Snyk can host your data in a number of regions. During initial onboarding of your system, you can work with your account team to select a multi-tenant region. For single-tenant availability (Snyk Private Cloud), reach out to your account team in advance of onboarding.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, customers are hosted in the US region.
{% endhint %}

## **What is data residency?**

Data residency allows you to control what region Snyk hosts a selected subset of your data in. For more information, see [Regional and global data](regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#regional-and-global-data).

Data residency is available for [Snyk Open Source](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source/), [Snyk Code](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/), [Snyk Container](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/), and [Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../scan-with-snyk/scan-infrastructure/scan-your-iac-source-code/).

## **How does data residency work?**

During your system onboarding, you can work with your account team to select a hosting region.

{% hint style="info" %}
After you select a region, the data in that region cannot be migrated to another region. Moving to a new region requires a complete re-onboarding.
{% endhint %}

## **What regions are available?**

Snyk offers data residency for the following regions:

|          Region         |           URL          |
| :---------------------: | :--------------------: |
|      USA (default)      |   https://app.snyk.io  |
| EU (Germany, Frankfurt) | https://app.eu.snyk.io |
|     AUS (Australia)     | https://app.au.snyk.io |

Single-tenant deployments may support more regions than the ones listed here, subject to validation of architectural service supportability by Snyk engineering.&#x20;

## Regional and global data

Snyk leverages a number of sub-processors to provide you with a high-quality service. Thus not all data types can be stored within your region of choice. The list of sub-processors is available [on the Snyk website](https://snyk.io/policies/subprocessors/).

See [How Snyk handles your data](how-snyk-handles-your-data.md) for product-specific examples of how this data is handled.

## Regional multi and single-tenant hosting notes

Snyk offers almost all the same features, support, and performance in the regional multi and single-tenant regions as in the US region. For an up-to-date overview of feature parity across regions, reach out to your account team.

#### **AU**

`snyk config set endpoint=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

Alternatively, have an environment variable on your machine or CI tool:

#### **EU**

`SNYK_API=https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`SNYK_API=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

When running Jenkins, use the additional argument:

`--API=https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`--API=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

### IDEs URLs

Snyk IDE extensions have similar modifiable options to the CLI and need to be configured to use the appropriate endpoint. In the extensions settings for Snyk in your IDE, set the **Custom Endpoint** parameter to the appropriate value for EU and AU as follows.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure you are using the latest version of IDE plugins. The following specifies the minimum version required:\
VSCode - 1.2.18\
Visual Studio - 1.1.21\
IntelliJ - 2.4.32

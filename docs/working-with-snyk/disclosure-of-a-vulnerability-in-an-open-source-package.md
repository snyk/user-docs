# Disclosure of a vulnerability in an open-source package

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that responsible disclosure of [security vulnerabilities in open-source packages helps us ensure](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/report-2020) the security and privacy of our users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community by which you can report security issues found within managed open-source code, within these languages: JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby, and PHP.

Our responsible disclosure program aims to protect both the maintainer and the reporting researcher, allowing maintainers and developers who use open-source code to safely benefit from the discovery of these vulnerabilities prior to public disclosure, and crediting those researchers for their dedication.

## Snyk's vulnerability disclosure program

The primary steps of our vulnerability disclosure program:

1. Any researcher or developer is invited to submit a **report** regarding an open-source [security vulnerability](https://snyk.io/learn/security-vulnerability-exploits-threats/) with full details.
2. Our Snyk Security team validates the claims in the report and the severity of the associated risks. See **Triaging and validation** for details.
3. We contact the owner or maintainer of the affected project, through multiple channels. See **Notification of the maintainer** for details.
4. We relay the vulnerability details, advise on potential fixes, and collaborate on a public disclosure timeline with the maintainer. See **Fix assistance** for details.
5. We publicly disclose the vulnerability, giving full credit to the researcher. See **Public disclosure** for details.
6. Snyk, as an officially recognized CVE Central Naming Authority (CNA), assigns a CVE to the vulnerability.

## Reporting vulnerabilities to Snyk

Vulnerability reports can be submitted by a researcher to report@snyk.io (`<`[`report@snyk.io`](mailto:report@snyk.io)`>`) directly, or via the Snyk Vulnerability Disclosure form: [https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/.](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) A submitted vulnerability report should contain the following details at a minimum:

* affected module
* relevant package manager/ecosystem
* vulnerability details
* steps to reproduce

Upon receipt of the report, Snyk validates and documents each reported vulnerability prior to notifying the maintainer.

Vulnerability disclosures sent to us via email can also be encrypted using the following PGP key:

## Triaging and validation

After validating a submitted vulnerability report, an analyst contacts the submitter (via the contact details attached to the report) to acknowledge receipt of the report, and to discuss vulnerability details as well as the severity we’ve assigned.

If the submitted vulnerability was already publicly disclosed and is simply missing from the [Snyk vulnerability database](https://security.snyk.io), then, once validated by Snyk, this vulnerability will be added and published in the database.

## Notifying the package maintainer

Upon successful validation of a submitted vulnerability, Snyk contacts the maintainer of the package in order to provide vulnerability details necessary to begin any internal resolution process.

Snyk follows a 90-day responsible disclosure and fix timeline, allowing the maintainer of the affected package to make sure a fix is available prior to the vulnerability being made public. Furthermore, an extension can be provided at the maintainer’s request, and depending on the severity of the disclosed vulnerability, Snyk is happy to wait for public disclosure until a patch is made available.

### After 30 days

If the maintainer does not acknowledge or reply to the initial disclosure email within 30 business days of the original notification, Snyk retransmits the vulnerability details to the original point of contact of the affected package and at least one secondary contact, if a secondary contact is publicly available.

### After 40 days

If an additional ten business days elapse with no response from the maintainer after the second notification (a total of 40 business days), vulnerability details are re-sent not only to the previous two contacts, but also to customers and other affected stakeholders at the discretion of Snyk.

### After 50 days

If the package maintainer does not respond to any of the three notification attempts within an additional ten business days following the third notification (50 business days since the original notification), or if the maintainer indicates they do not wish to coordinate disclosure, Snyk may elect to issue a public advisory with no further collaboration.

### Acknowledging receipt

Maintainers should acknowledge receipt of notification with the following details:

* Confirmation that the vulnerability information has been received
* The scheduled timeline for investigation.
* A point of contact responsible for coordinating and tracking information on the issue from within their organization.
* An estimate as to when they expect to complete their initial investigation of the security issue as was provided in the notification.

## Fix assistance

Once the maintainer acknowledges receipt of notification, Snyk works with the maintainer to determine how to handle the security issue within ten business days. The following tasks are included in this phase:

* Snyk is happy to provide additional information to assist the maintainer in the development of a solution.
* The maintainer and Snyk collaborate together to time public disclosure and fix of the issue.

## Public disclosure

As part of the public disclosure phase, Snyk:

* Assigns a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number for public tracking
* Adds the vulnerability to its public vulnerability database ([https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/)), providing information about the vulnerability and the related fix

Public disclosure may be initiated either by completing the Fix Assistance phase or through a process failure in prior phases.

During the Public Disclosure phase Snyk, and preferably the maintainer, disseminate information about the vulnerability and the fix to the public. Snyk might disseminate information through public email lists, web pages or any other medium it deems appropriate to reach the intended audiences.

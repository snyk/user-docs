# Snyk Residency Services

Snyk Residency Services (hereinafter Residency Services) are remote consulting services that provide Snyk Customers with access to a Snyk expert to assist with the Customer’s configuration and adoption of the Snyk Applications to achieve success long term. Residency Services allow Snyk experts to get to know the Customer’s business and processes to help deliver tailored recommendations for the Customer’s DevSecOps and other key internal stakeholders. The designated Snyk Services Engineer (the “Snyk Consultant”) will work with the customer directly using hours from a pre-purchased declining balance of hours. Residency Services may be used for a variety of tasks to meet the Customer’s business needs.

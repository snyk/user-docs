# Create a .dcignore file

To ignore certain files and directories, for example, `node_modules`, create a `.dcignore` file. You can create it in any directory on any level, starting from the directory where your Project resides. The file syntax is identical to `.gitignore`.

* Snyk recommends adding the file when there is no `.gitignore` file. Adding the file significantly reduces the files that need to be uploaded and speeds up the analysis.
* To quickly add the default `.dcignore` file, use the command provided by VS Code and the Snyk extension, `snyk create .dcignore file`, and save the newly created `.dcignore` file.

# Developer guardrails for agentic workflows

Agentic workflows are changing how we build software. AI assistants now help write code, automate tasks, and speed up development. While this boosts productivity, it is crucial to ensure the code generated by AI is secure. Snyk is developing tools to provide these essential security guardrails, letting you innovate quickly and safely.

The speed of AI development brings new security risks. AI models can sometimes generate code with vulnerabilities, use outdated libraries, or suggest insecure practices. Without proper checks, these flaws can slip into your applications, increasing your security risks. Snyk helps you prevent this by embedding security directly into your AI-assisted workflows.

Snyk is integrating its security expertise into these AI workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is an open standard that lets AI tools communicate with platforms like Snyk to get necessary context and perform actions. Snyk's MCP server, part of the Snyk CLI, allows AI agents to use Snyk's scanning capabilities directly.

This integration means your AI assistants can autonomously run Snyk scans for code, open-source dependencies, and configurations. As AI generates or suggests code, it can instantly check with Snyk for vulnerabilities. This brings security checks right into the early stages of AI-powered development, catching issues before they become bigger problems.

Snyk's MCP support works hand-in-hand with the existing Snyk IDE plugins. While IDE plugins offer real-time feedback to developers as they code, the MCP server extends this security coverage to AI-generated code. This creates a powerful combination, ensuring both human-written and AI-generated code is checked, providing a secure foundation for your AI-driven development.

# CLI tools

The CLI tools extend the user of the Snyk CLI by performing analysis and transformation of output in specific ways. For details, see [`snyk-delta`](snyk-delta.md), [`snyk-filter`](snyk-filter.md), and [`snyk-to-html`](snyk-to-html.md).

For information about additional tools, see [Snyk Tools](../../../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-tools/).

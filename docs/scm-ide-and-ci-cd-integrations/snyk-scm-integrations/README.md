# Snyk SCM Integrations

You can integrate Snyk with your Git repository to quickly and easily gain visibility across all the [Snyk Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/introducing-snyk/introduction-to-snyk-projects) that you add to your **Projects** list.

This page contains information about the following Snyk SCM integration aspects:

* [Snyk Essentials SCM integrations available at the Group level](./#group-level-snyk-apprisk-scm-integrations)
* [Snyk SCM integrations available at the Organization level](./#organization-level-snyk-scm-integrations)
* [Workspaces for SCM integrations](./#workspaces-for-scm-integrations)
* [Deployment order recommendations](./#deployment-order-recommendations)
* [General user permissions and access scope requirements](./#user-permissions-and-access-scope-requirements)
* [Integrated SCM tokens for Snyk Broker](./#integrated-scm-tokens-for-snyk-broker)

## Overview

When you want to add new integrations to your Snyk account you must first decide the level type at which you want to install the integration. Snyk supports different SCM integrations on different levels of the Snyk hierarchy:

* [Group level ](./#group-level-snyk-apprisk-integrations)- Group level integrations only support Snyk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk.
* [Organization level](./#organization-level-snyk-integrations) - Organization level integrations support all other Snyk products. Snyk does not support Snyk Essentials or Snyk AppRisk integrations at the Organization level.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you added the GitHub integration at Organizational and/or Group levels and you have configured SAML SSO for it, then you must authorize your GitHub PAT. Navigate to the [How to authorize your Personal Access Token and enable SSO](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/github-enterprise#how-to-authorize-your-personal-access-token-and-enable-sso) page for more details.
{% endhint %}

## Group level - Snyk Essentials SCM integrations

At the Group level, you can set up and customize your Snyk Essentials integrations from the **Integrations Hub** where the following SCMs are available:

* [GitHub](github-enterprise.md#github-setup-guide-for-snyk-apprisk)
* [GitLab](gitlab.md#gitlab-setup-guide)
* [Azure DevOps](azure-repositories-tfs.md#azure-devops-setup-guide)
* [BitBucket](bitbucket-cloud.md#bitbucket-setup-guide)

Snyk Essentials Group-level SCM integrations provide broader visibility into all the application assets for a given customer and pull in the additional application context and, or metadata, for example, information on developers, commits, and so on.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your SCM instance is not publicly accessible, you must connect using Snyk Broker. For details, see [Snyk Broker - Snyk Essentials](../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/using-snyk-essentials-with-snyk-broker.md).
{% endhint %}

The Integrations page at the Group level shows all active integrations, including any data automatically synced from your existing Snyk Organizations, and provides access to the Integration Hub.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The SCM integrations use an incremental approach to retrieve repositories. This means that when a sync is initiated, it checks the last update time of the repository and only transfers the repositories that have been modified since then.

If there have been changes to the scope of the user or PAT used for the integration, any repositories that are newly within scope will only be identified after either a change to trigger the incremental collection or a change to the integration configuration itself.
{% endhint %}

The following supported Snyk data are automatically synced:

* Snyk Open Source
* Snyk Code
* Snyk IaC
* Snyk Container

Each connected integration enables you to:

* Pause data syncing
* Modify integration profiles and configurations
* Delete the integration
* Check when the integration was last synced and when the next sync is scheduled.

See the [Integration syncing time](../../integrate-with-snyk/#integrations-syncing-time) for more details about the time required to sync for each action.

### Wildcard SCM integration

The wildcard integration allows you to use a special character to detect and integrate multiple SCM organizations simultaneously.

{% hint style="info" %}
The wildcard integration applies to the GitHub integration and offers support when you set it up using [Snyk Broker](../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/using-snyk-essentials-with-snyk-broker.md).
{% endhint %}

You can use the wildcards while setting up your integration using the Integration Hub:

* Open the **Integration Hub** menu.
* Select the **SCM** tag and search for GitHub or Azure DevOps.
* Click the **Add** button.
* In the **Organizations** field, add the Organization details by using the `*` symbol. For example, using `*snyk` integrates all SCM Organizations that have Snyk in their name.
* All the Organizations that match with the wildcard, `*` symbol will be added.

{% hint style="info" %}
The wildcard, `*` symbol is considered a living command and will be applied every time you are rescanning your repositories.
{% endhint %}

### Snyk Essentials and Snyk AppRisk integrations ecosystem

You can refer to the table below to verify the availability and compatibility of all integrations for Snyk Essentials and Snyk AppRisk. The integrations are categorized by type, listed by name, and indicated as available or not for both Snyk Essentials and Snyk AppRisk.

### Using the Integration Hub

Use the Integration Hub page to onboard integrations and populate Snyk Essentials with data from SCM tools.

See the [Snyk Web UI](../../getting-started/snyk-web-ui.md#manage-your-integrations) page for step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration.

After the integration is validated, a card is displayed on the Integrations page, allowing you to enable or disable the connection, edit the settings, or remove the connection from your configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you modify the permissions and scopes after the initial configuration, it is essential to either initiate an import or implement a change within the repository. This action allows Snyk to acknowledge and incorporate the updates effectively.
{% endhint %}

### Using Snyk Broker

If your SCM instance is not publicly accessible, you need Snyk Broker. You can install and configure your Snyk Broker using Docker or Helm. For more information about Snyk Broker, see the Snyk Broker documentation, including [Snyk Broker](../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/using-snyk-essentials-with-snyk-broker.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Enable the Snyk Essentials flag in your Snyk Broker deployment environment before running the commands.
{% endhint %}

You can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/broker/tree/565242baf003f06f445489dd96cc68c8386ede38/defaultFilters/apprisk) all the updated `.json` files that include the allowed list of accessible endpoints for the integrations.

## Organization level - Snyk SCM integrations

Snyk provides seamless integrations with various source control management systems such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos at the Organizational level. These integrations enable you to automatically scan for vulnerabilities and receive actionable insights to enhance the security of your repositories. By integrating at this level, you can ensure comprehensive protection for all your Projects within the Organization.

Snyk Source Control Manager (SCM) integrations allow you to:

* Continuously perform security scanning across all integrated repositories
* Detect vulnerabilities in your open-source components
* Provide automated fixes

Snyk can integrate with the following SCMs to help you track, monitor, and fix the issues and vulnerabilities in your code:

* [GitHub Cloud App](github-cloud-app.md)
* [GitHub Enterprise](github-enterprise.md)
* [GitHub](github.md)
* [GitHub Read-only Projects](github-read-only-projects.md)
* [GitLab](gitlab.md)
* [Bitbucket Cloud](bitbucket-cloud.md)
* [Bitbucket Cloud App](bitbucket-cloud-app.md)
* [Bitbucket Data Center/Server](bitbucket-data-center-server.md)
* [Azure Repositories (TFS)](azure-repositories-tfs.md)

## Workspaces for SCM integrations

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Cloud App, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Cloud App, Bitbucket Cloud (Legacy), and Azure Repos (TFS) integrations.
{% endhint %}

The Workspaces feature enables Snyk to ingest a temporary snapshot of repository contents, and all commit metadata through your configured SCM integrations.

For detailed information on this feature, including enablement steps, see [Workspaces for SCM integrations](introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/workspaces-for-scm-integrations.md).

## Deployment order recommendations

If you try to implement all the SCM integration features at the same time, you risk causing friction in your software development life cycle ([SDLC](https://snyk.io/learn/secure-sdlc/)), which in turn leads to a poor developer experience.

To ensure a smooth rollout of Snyk across your organization, Snyk provides a suggested deployment timeline consisting of deployment stages, configuration steps, and the desired outcome for each stage.

For detailed steps, see [Deployment recommendations for SCM integrations](introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/deployment-recommendations-for-scm-integrations.md).

## User permissions and access scope requirements

Snyk SCM integrations may require different permission requirements based on the connection method.

See the following for detailed permission requirements:

* [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](./#github-and-github-enterprise-permissions-requirements)
* [GitHub Cloud App](./#github-cloud-app-permission-requirements)
* [GitHub Server App](./#github-server-app-permission-requirements)
* [GitHub Server App for Universal Broker](./#github-server-app-for-universal-broker-permission-requirements)
* [GitLab](./#gitlab-permission-requirements)
* [Bitbucket](./#bitbucket-permission-requirements)
* [Azure Repositories (TFS)](./#azure-repositories-tfs-permission-requirements)

### GitHub and GitHub Enterprise permissions requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
For information about token permissions in a brokered integration, see [GitHub - prerequisites and steps to install and configure Broker](https://docs.snyk.io/enterprise-configuration/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-snyk-broker/github-prerequisites-and-steps-to-install-and-configure-broker) and [Integrated SCM tokens for Snyk Broker](./#integrated-scm-tokens-for-snyk-broker).
{% endhint %}

The Snyk GitHub Enterprise integration is bound to a single user, preferably a GitHub service account. The level of access for the integration is defined by the combination of the user's permissions in GitHub and the access defined for the Personal Access Token (PAT) on that user's account. If the PAT is defined with more permission than the user's GitHub account, the integration will not be able to use that permission.

The following table details the access scopes required in GitHub and GitHub Enterprise for Personal Access Tokens (PAT) and the scopes required for Snyk to perform the required operations on monitored repositories, such as reading manifest files on a frequent basis and opening fix or upgrade PRs. GitHub custom roles are not supported.

<table><thead><tr><th width="259">Action and purpose</th><th align="center">PAT scopes</th><th align="center">Repository scopes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Daily/weekly tests:</strong><br>Read manifest files in private repositories.</td><td align="center"><code>repo (all)</code></td><td align="center">≥ <code>read</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manual fix pull requests:</strong><br>Create fix PRs in monitored repositories.</td><td align="center"><code>repo (all)</code></td><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Automatic fix and upgrade pull requests:</strong><br>Create fix or upgrade PRs in monitored repositories.</td><td align="center"><code>repo (all)</code></td><td align="center">≥ <code>write</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Snyk tests on pull requests:</strong><br>Send PR status checks whenever a new PR is created, or an existing PR is updated.</td><td align="center"><code>repo (all)</code></td><td align="center">≥ <code>write</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial configuration of Snyk tests on pull requests:</strong><br>Used to add SCM webhooks to the imported repo</td><td align="center"><code>admin:repo_hooks (read &#x26; write)</code></td><td align="center"><code>admin</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Import new Projects to Snyk:</strong><br>Present a list of all the available repos in the GitHub org in the <strong>Add Projects</strong> screen.</td><td align="center"><code>admin:read:org</code><br><code>repo (all)</code></td><td align="center"></td></tr></tbody></table>

A fine-grained PAT requires additional repository access scopes:

* `Administration: Read-only`
* `Commit Status: Read and write`
* `Content: Read and write`
* `Metadata: Read-only`
* `Pull requests: Read and write`
* `Webhooks: Read and write`
* `Members access: Read-only (Organization access scope)`

The `Administration: Read-only` permission on the PAT is crucial for Snyk to identify and list the user's accessible GitHub organizations, a prerequisite for importing a new Project.

Snyk uses PRs to tell [GitHub Enterprise](github-enterprise.md) that a merge is to occur. To do this, change content is pushed into a branch, which requires the `content: write` scope. A separate call is then made to create the fix PR, which requires the `pull request: write` scope. GitHub Enterprise is then instructed to create a PR, merging the change branch into the default branch.

Snyk uses SCM webhooks to:

* Track the state of Snyk pull requests when PRs are created, updated triggered, merged, and so on.
* Send push events to trigger PR checks.

### GitHub Cloud App permission requirements

The [Snyk GitHub Cloud App](github-cloud-app.md) integration uses role-based access control, meaning access control is not dependent on individual users or their role, it is instead tied to the app entity.

To set up the GitHub Cloud app integration you must be a:

* Snyk Organization Admin.
* GitHub Organization Admin.
* GitHub Repository Admin (if installing through the GitHub UI).

{% hint style="info" %}
While some permissions may be optional from GitHub’s perspective, they are necessary to support Snyk functions. These permissions **cannot be customized** for your individual needs because the app is registered under the Snyk Organization.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The following table states the required GitHub App permissions and scopes:

<table><thead><tr><th width="191">Action and scope</th><th width="254">Scope</th><th>Level</th><th>Permission</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Determine if the GitHub user has admin role on the GitHub org, to restrict app installation reuse to only admin users</td><td>Members</td><td>Organization</td><td>Read</td></tr><tr><td>Search repositories, and access repository metadata.</td><td>Metadata</td><td>Repository</td><td>Read</td></tr><tr><td>Interact with the GitHub Checks tab</td><td>Checks</td><td>Repository</td><td>Read and write</td></tr><tr><td>Create commits and branches</td><td>Contents</td><td>Repository</td><td>Read and write</td></tr><tr><td>Send PR check results as commit statuses</td><td>Commit status</td><td>Repository</td><td>Read and write</td></tr><tr><td>Get pull requests details, post related comments (next gen PR experience)</td><td>Pull request</td><td>Repository</td><td>Read and write</td></tr><tr><td>Manage webhooks which trigger the PR checks</td><td>Repository hooks</td><td>Repository</td><td>Read and write</td></tr></tbody></table>

### GitHub Server App permission requirements

To set up the GitHub Server App you must be a:

* Snyk Organization Admin.
* GitHub Organization Admin.

You must have a public or private GitHub repository.

### GitHub Server App for Universal Broker permission requirements

To set up the GitHub Server App for Universal Broker you must be a:

* Snyk Organization Admin.
* GitHub Organization Admin.

You must have a self-hosted instance of GitHub.

### GitLab permission requirements

The [Snyk GitLab integration](gitlab.md#gitlab-access-tokens) uses either a personal access token (PAT) or group access token (GAT), depending on the GitLab account tier you are on.

To set up the Snyk GitLab integration you must be a:

* Snyk Group or Organization Admin.
* GitLab Owner or Maintainer

A PAT is used for managing personal GitLab projects and requires the `api` scope. For Snyk Essentials to show all repositories from GitLab, the user generating the PAT should be part of the GitLab group where their GitLab permissions can be a minimum of Guest.

A GAT is used for managing multiple GitLab projects in a GitLab group and requires the `api` scope and maintainer role selected from the dropdown. You must be a GitLab Premium or Ultimate account tier holder to create a GAT.

### Bitbucket permission requirements

The Snyk Bitbucket integrations use different access control mechanisms to connect with Snyk:

* [Snyk Bitbucket Cloud](./#bitbucket-cloud-and-bitbucket-data-center-server-scopes) requires the creation of an [app password](bitbucket-cloud.md#how-to-set-up-the-snyk-bitbucket-cloud-integration).
* [Snyk Bitbucket Cloud App](./#bitbucket-cloud-app-scopes) requires [Bitbucket workspace authorization](bitbucket-cloud-app.md#setting-up-a-bitbucket-cloud-app) and related permissions.
* [Snyk Bitbucket Data Center/Server](./#bitbucket-cloud-and-bitbucket-data-center-server-scopes) requires a [dedicated username and password](bitbucket-data-center-server.md#how-to-set-up-a-bitbucket-dc-server-integration) or a personal access token (PAT).

{% hint style="warning" %}
To set up any Snyk Bitbucket integration, you must be a Bitbucket Workspace Admin.
{% endhint %}

#### Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Data Center/Server scopes

The following table details the required permission scopes in Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Data Center/Serve&#x72;**:**

| Action and purpose                                                                                                                                      |                                                                       App password requirements                                                                      | Bitbucket permissions |

Snyk uses SCM webhooks in Bitbucket to:

* Track the state of pull requests when PRs are created, updated triggered, merged, and so on.
* Send push events to trigger PR checks.

#### Bitbucket Cloud App scopes

The following table details the permissions required for the **Bitbucket Cloud App**:

| Action                                              | Purpose                                                                                                                                       | Required Scope                                            |

| Snyk tests on pull requests - initial configuration | Used to add Snyk webhooks to the imported repos, to notify Snyk when pull requests are created or updated, and enable Snyk to trigger a scan. | Read and modify your repositories' webhooks               |

### Azure Repositories (TFS) permission requirements

The [Snyk Azure Repositories (TFS) integration](azure-repositories-tfs.md) uses an Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT). This token is configured with the specific permissions Snyk needs to access your Azure repositories.

To set up the Snyk Azure Repositories (TFS) integration you must be:

* A [Snyk Organization Admin](../../snyk-admin/user-roles/pre-defined-roles.md).
* A member of the [Project Administrators group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions?view=azure-devops\&tabs=preview-page) in Azure. This ensures the PAT has the `edit subscriptions permissions` required to enable webhooks.

In Azure, the PAT requires the following permissions for Snyk access:

* **Expiry**: Custom defined. Snyk recommends choosing a token expiration date that is far in the future.&#x20;
* **Scopes**: Custom defined. `Read & write` permissions are needed for the **Code** scope.

## Integrated SCM tokens for Snyk Broker

An integrated SCM token is required for [Broker client setup](../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/#integrations-with-snyk-broker). It is used in the `-e <SCM>_TOKEN` parameter, for example, `-e GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx…`, to enable access to the SCM. These meet certain permissions needed for the operation of Broker and Snyk Code.

An integrated SCM token can be generated for the following SCM integrations:

* [GitHub and GitHub Enterprise](./#github-and-github-enterprise-scm-token)
* [GitLab](./#gitlab-scm-token)
* [Azure Repositories (TFS)](./#azure-repositories-tfs-scm-token)

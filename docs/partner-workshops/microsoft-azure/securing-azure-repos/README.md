# Securing Azure Repos

### Welcome

This workshop builds upon the **Securing AKS &** **Securing ACR** modules which provided you with sample patterns and reference architectures for securing [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) workloads with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/). Now, we will extend that learning and cover scanning of source code in [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/). Microsoft Azure Repos is part of [Microsoft Azure DevOps Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/devops/). We will provide you with step-by-step examples and sample code that will walk you through deployment of supporting infrastructure, sample applications, and configuration of the various Snyk integrations to Microsoft Azure.

The Snyk security integration is free and easy to set up with just a few clicks inside the Bitbucket Cloud product. For the first time, developers can consume information that was previously only available inside Snyk now within Bitbucket Cloud. Snyk enables developers to see new vulnerabilities as they emerge and implement fixes early and quickly in the process. Learn more about this exciting new integration by reading this [blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-native-integration-atlassian-bitbucket-cloud-security/).

Snyk is proud to partner with Atlassian! Read more about our partnership [here](https://snyk.io/atlassian/). Snyk and Atlassian have come together to integrate security with Bitbucket Cloud and find, fix, and monitor vulnerabilities, making [DevSecOps easy](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/features/devsecops).

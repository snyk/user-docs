# Snyk Tools

## Scope of Snyk Tools

Snyk Tools help with specific "pain points" that may not be addressed by Snyk product functionality, regardless of whether you use Snyk through the Web UI, CLI, API, or an integration. Snyk Tools extend the functions of the Snyk API and the Snyk CLI.

You must have a [Snyk Account](https://snyk.io/login?cta=sign-up\&loc=nav\&page=support\_docs\_page) with populated Projects to use Snyk Tools.

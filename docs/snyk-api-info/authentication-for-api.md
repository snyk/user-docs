# Authentication for API

To use the Snyk API, you must first get your API token from Snyk.

1. Go to the **General Account Settings** in [your Snyk account](https://app.snyk.io/account).
2. In the KEY field, **click to show** and then select and copy your API token. Refer to the screenshot that follows.
3. To use the Snyk API, supply the token in an `Authorization` header, preceded by `Token`:\
   `Authorization: Token API_KEY`

For more information about authentication, refer to the overview in the [API reference docs](https://apidocs.snyk.io/). For additional information, see [Revoking and regenerating Snyk API tokens](revoking-and-regenerating-snyk-api-tokens.md).

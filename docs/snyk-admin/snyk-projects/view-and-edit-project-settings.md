Click **GitHub integration** to edit SCM-specific settings. This also applies to other SCMs.

You can edit the **Project Notification Settings** and update the **Test & Automated Pull Request Frequency**. You can also retrieve the **Project ID** for use in Snyk API calls.

{% hint style="info" %}
The default test frequency and available test frequencies vary depending on the type of Project: Open Source, Code analysis, Container, or IaC. For more information, see [Test frequency settings](./#test-frequency-settings) on the Snyk Projects page. You can also set test frequency by using the Snyk REST API endpoint [Updates project by project ID](https://apidocs.snyk.io/#patch-/orgs/-org\_id-/projects/-project\_id-).
{% endhint %}

5. After applying all the filters you want, click **Save changes** next to the drop-down. Your Project view will be updated.
6. If you want to configure a Project view, select different filters and click **Save changes** again. You can also discard any changes to a Project view before you save them to return it to its most recent saved state.

## Share a Project view with another member of your Organization

1. From the Project views drop-down, select the Project view you would like to share with another Organization member.

2. Once the Project view has loaded on the screen, copy the page URL. This URL can be shared with anyone in your Organization.

When you open the link for the view, the Project listing page is organized by the filters applied through the Project view with that URL.

The name of the view will not appear in the Project view drop-down, and other users cannot modify your Project view.

## View reports on your Projects

1. From the Project view drop-down, select the Project view for which you would like to view the report.
2. Next to the FILTERS drop-down, click the **See report for these projects button**.

## View dependencies in Snyk Open Source

Snyk uses the package manager for your application to build the dependency tree and display it in the **Dependencies** tab of the Project issues detail page for Open Source. This tab shows which components introduce a vulnerability, indicating how the dependency was introduced to the application.

An example follows:

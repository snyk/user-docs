For Enterprise plan customers who create custom member roles, Snyk prevents users from assigning roles to other users who have more privileges. If you try to update the role of a member, invite a new member, or add an existing member with a role that has more privileges than you have, you will see the error **Cannot assign higher privilege role**.

# Manage users in Organizations and Groups

Snyk has features to [manage users in Organizations](manage-users-in-organizations.md) and to [manage users in a Group](manage-users-in-a-group.md). You can use the Snyk API v1 to [provision users to Orgs](../user-management-with-the-snyk-api/provision-users-to-orgs-using-the-snyk-api-v1.md) and [remove members from Groups and Orgs](../user-management-with-the-snyk-api/remove-members-from-groups-and-orgs-using-the-snyk-rest-and-v1-api.md).

You can [use Organization access requests](requests-for-access-to-an-organization.md) to add users and [configure session length for a Snyk Group](configure-session-length-for-a-snyk-group.md).

When you want to find out when a new user was added or analyze unexpected activity, you can [retrieve audit logs of user-initiated activity](../user-management-with-the-snyk-api/retrieve-audit-logs-of-user-initiated-activity-by-api-for-an-org-or-group.md) by Organization or Group through the Snyk REST API.

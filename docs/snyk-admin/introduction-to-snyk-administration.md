## Groups, Organizations, and Projects

Snyk has a hierarchy that allows you to control access to features such as scans:

* **Group:** the highest level; for example, the entire company.
* **Organization:** the second level of grouping; for example, your team.
* **Projects:** the lowest level for individual Projects; for example, a container image.&#x20;

See [Manage Groups and Organizations](manage-groups-and-organizations/) for details.

## Member (user) types

Snyk provides four different types of members (users):

* Collaborator
* Organization administrator
* Group member
* Group administrator

For definitions of the associated permissions per role, see [Managing permissions](manage-users-and-permissions/managing-permissions.md#permissions-per-role).

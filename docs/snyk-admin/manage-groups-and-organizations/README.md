## Groups, Organizations, and Projects

Snyk has a [hierarchy](../introduction-to-snyk-administration.md#accounts-groups-organizations-targets-and-projects) that allows you to control access to Snyk scanning and features. Key parts of the hierarchy are illustrated in this diagram:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (2).png" alt="Groups, Organizations and Projects"><figcaption><p>Groups, Organizations and Projects</p></figcaption></figure>

* [**Groups**](introduction-to-groups.md): Often, a Group encompasses your entire base of Snyk users, although large companies may have multiple Groups. Groups can contain multiple Organizations.
* [**Organizations**](whats-a-snyk-organization.md): An Organization represents a specific business area, such as a team. Organizations can contain multiple Projects.
* [**Projects**](../snyk-projects/)**:** A Project is established based on the item that Snyk scans for issues, such as a manifest file. Each Project shows the results of scans. You can configure your Projects to define how to scan for issues in that Project.

The documentation in this section covers [Groups](introduction-to-groups.md) and [Organizations](whats-a-snyk-organization.md).

## Groups, Organizations, and Projects

Snyk has a hierarchy that allows you to control access to features and scans:

* [**Groups**](introduction-to-groups.md): your entire base of Snyk users. Groups can contain multiple Organizations.
* [**Organizations**](whats-a-snyk-organization.md): represent specific business areas such as teams. Organizations can contain multiple Projects.
* [**Projects**](./#snyk-projects)**:** define the items that Snyk scans for issues (such as manifest files), along with configuration information defining how to run that scan.

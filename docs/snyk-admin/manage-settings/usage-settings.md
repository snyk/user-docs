## Contributing developers

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk has developer counts are for the GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and GitLab integrations and for the Snyk CLI.
{% endhint %}

Snyk defines contributing developers as developers having made a commit to a private repo monitored by Snyk in the last 90 days.

The **Contributing developers for Git and CLI integrations** section shows contributing developer counts, both at the Organization level and the Group level.

The counts indicate the number of contributing developers to the default branch of the private repos connected with the integration.

Snyk does not count contributions to public (open-source) repos because the pricing model is based on the number of contributing developers to private repositories.

An example of the count of contributing developers follows:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image__10_.png" alt="Contributing developers count"><figcaption><p>Contributing developers count</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Total unique contributors across all integrations:** the number of contributors across all the integrations in your Snyk account. Contributing developers are only counted once, even if they have contributed to multiple integrations or multiple repositories.
* **Breakdown by integration**: the number of contributors, Organizations, and repos in that integration.

Each contributor is **counted by** the **author** email field, which is set within the local Git configuration in the developerâ€™s machine.

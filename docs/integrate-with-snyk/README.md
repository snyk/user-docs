# Integrate with Snyk

Many integrations are available for using third-party functionality within Snyk and using Snyk with other tools. See [SCM, IDE, and CI/CD workflow and integrations](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/) for information on integrations and other methods of accomplishing that workflow.

This page identifies additional Snyk integrations and where to find them.

Snyk provides plugins for repository gatekeepers and integrations to connect with package repositories:

* [Gatekeeper plugins](gatekeeper-plugins/)
* [Package repository integrations](../scan-using-snyk/snyk-open-source/scan-open-source-libraries-and-licenses/package-repository-integrations/)

There are integrations that support Snyk Container and Snyk Iac:

* [Snyk Container integrations](snyk-container-integrations/)
* [Cloud platforms integrations](../scan-using-snyk/snyk-iac/cloud-platforms-integrations/)

Integrations for [event forwarding](event-forwarding/) allow you to push Snyk platform events directly to certain products on other platforms, enabling you to set up custom alerting, build your own reporting, trigger automation, and more.

[Notification and ticketing systems integrations](jira-and-slack-integrations/) help you work with Snyk in Jira and Slack.

Information is also provided on how Snyk can work with [vulnerability management tools](vulnerability-management-tools/).

Snyk provides alternative reporting tools. For more information, see [Reporting and BI integrations](../manage-risk/reporting/reporting-and-bi-integrations-snowflake-data-share.md).

Connecting a custom Artifactory Package Repository enables Snyk to resolve all direct and transitive dependencies of packages hosted on the custom registry and calculate a more complete, accurate dependency graph and related vulnerabilities.

You can configure these types of Artifactory Package Repository:

* Publicly accessible instances protected by basic authentication
* Instances on a private network accessed through Snyk Broker (with or without basic authentication).

These instructions apply to configuring publicly accessible instances. For instructions on configuring a brokered instance, see [Set up Snyk Broker with Artifactory Repository](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-snyk-broker/artifactory-repository-install-and-configure-broker/set-up-snyk-broker-with-artifactory-repository.md).

The steps to set up Artifactory Repository Manager follow.

1. Go to settings <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/cog_icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> > **Integrations > Package Repositories > Artifactory**.
2. Enter the URL of your Artifactory instance, this **must** end with **/artifactory**.
3. Enter your username and password.
4. Select **Save**.

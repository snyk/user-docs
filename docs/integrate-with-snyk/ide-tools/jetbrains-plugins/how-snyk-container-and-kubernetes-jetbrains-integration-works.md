# How Snyk Container and Kubernetes JetBrains integration works

The JetBrains plugin scans your Kubernetes workload files and collects the images used. To troubleshoot whether the plugin is correctly scanning a container image, you can verify the following:

* Whether the image definition is in the Kubernetes YAML file in the project. Make sure you have the image is specified with an image name mapped in the format `imageValue:imageKey` for the image yaml attribute, for example, `image:nginx:1.17.1`.
* Whether the container image has been successfully built locally or pushed to a container registry or both. It is also a good practice to verify this before referring to the container image in the Kubernetes YAML file.

If you encounter an error [contact support](https://snyk.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard).

For each image found, perform a test with the Snyk CLI.

* Refer to the [doc for testing a container image](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/snyk-cli-for-container-security#testing-an-image) for more information about how Snyk Container performs a test on the image.
* While testing the image the CLI downloads the image if it is not already available locally in your Docker daemon.
* Snyk plans to expand the scope of container scanning, so if there are more files, such as  Dockerfiles or workflows that you want to be supported, submit a feature request [to Snyk support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new).

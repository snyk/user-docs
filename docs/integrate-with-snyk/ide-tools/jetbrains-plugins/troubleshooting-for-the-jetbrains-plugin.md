# Troubleshooting for the JetBrains plugin

To obtain plugin logs, navigate to **Help** > **Show Log in Finder** (Mac) or **Show Log in Explorer** (Windows).

You can find more help on locating logs in [the IntelliJ support article](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207241085-Locating-IDE-log-files).

## Trusted root certificates issues

Please refer to [JetBrains documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ssl-certificates.html) on how IDE resolves custom certificates and how to import them, in case plugin experiences any network failures due to incorrect configuration.

# Visual Studio Code extension authentication

To scan your projects you must authenticate with Snyk. The extension uses your Snyk API [token](../../../snyk-api-info/authentication-for-api.md) for authentication. To store the token securely, Snyk uses [Secret Storage API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage), which uses the system's keychain to manage the token.

## Logging in

To authenticate follow these steps:

1.  Once the extension is installed, click on the Snyk Icon in the left navigation bar:

2.  Click **Connect VS Code with Snyk**. The extension relies on the Snyk authentication API and asks you to authenticate your machine against the Snyk web application:

3. Click **Authenticate**.
4.  After successful authentication, view the confirmation message. If you need to authenticate using your API token, [How to obtain and authenticate with your Snyk API token](../../../getting-started/how-to-obtain-and-authenticate-with-your-snyk-api-token.md). Be sure to use your personal token.

5. Close the browser window and return to VS Code. VS Code is now reading and saving the authentication on your local machine.

## Switching accounts

To re-authenticate with a different account, follow these steps:

1. Run the provided `Snyk: Log Out` command.
2. When you have logged out, click **Connect VS Code with Snyk** to authenticate with a different account.

Or you run `Snyk: Set Token` command and set your [token](../../../snyk-api-info/authentication-for-api.md) in the text field manually.

## Requirements for Linux and Unix

When authenticating with Snyk, users have the option to copy the authentication URL to their clipboard.

For Linux and Unix users, this requires that the `xclip` or `xsel` utility be installed.

# Analysis results: Snyk Code

Snyk Code analysis shows Security and Quality issues in your code with every scan. The scan runs in the background and is enabled by default.

On the **Problems** tab of the Visual Studio Code results screen, you can see all Code issues found in your project.

The Snyk suggestion panel on the right of the results screen shows the Snyk Code Vulnerability name, the line it was found in, a suggestion for a fix ,and an option to ignore (either in the entire file or a specific line).

Snyk also includes a feedback mechanism to report false positives so others do not see the same issue (bottom left).

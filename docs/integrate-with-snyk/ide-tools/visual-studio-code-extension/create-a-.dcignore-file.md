# Create a .dcignore file

To ignore certain files and directories (for example, **node\_modules**), create a **.dcignore** file. You can create it in any directory on any level starting from the directory where your project resides. The file syntax is identical to .`gitignore`.

* Snyk recommends adding the file when there is no `.gitignore` file. Adding the file significantly reduces the files that need to be uploaded and speeds up the analysis.
* To quickly add the default **`.dcignore`** file, use the command provided by VS Code and the Snyk extension **Snyk create `.dcignore` file** and save the newly created `.dcignore` file.

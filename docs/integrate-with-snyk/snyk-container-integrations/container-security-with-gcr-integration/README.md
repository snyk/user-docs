# Container security with GCR integration

Snyk integrates with Google Container Registry (GCR) so you can import your Projects, monitor your containers for vulnerabilities, and fix vulnerabilities as you work. Snyk tests the Projects you have imported for any known security vulnerabilities at a frequency you control.

# Language support for Bitbucket Pipelines integration

Snyk integration with Bitbucket pipes is supported for the following languages:

* JavaScript (npm)
* .NET (NuGet)
* PHP Composer
* Ruby
* Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
Bitbucket pipeline implementation for Java (Maven and Gradle) requires the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli).
{% endhint %}

Language support can be extended through the use of [user defined custom images](user-defined-custom-images.md). Using a custom image extends the support to [Snyk-supported environments](broken-reference).

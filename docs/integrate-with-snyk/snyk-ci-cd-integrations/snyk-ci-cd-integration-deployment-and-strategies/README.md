# Snyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies

When you decide to use a Snyk CI/CD Integration, typically you will adopt the integration in specific stages. You will also choose a deployment method. See [CI/CD adoption and deployment](ci-cd-adoption-and-deployment.md).

Set up the CI/CD Integration. See [CI/CD setup](ci-cd-setup.md).

You will be using snyk test and snyk monitor in the CI/CD integration. [See Snyk test and snyk monitor in CI/CD integration](snyk-test-and-snyk-monitor-in-ci-cd-integration.md).

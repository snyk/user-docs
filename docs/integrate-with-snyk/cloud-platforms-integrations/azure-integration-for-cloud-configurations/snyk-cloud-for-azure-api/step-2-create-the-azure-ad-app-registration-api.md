# Step 2: Create the Azure AD app registration (API)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have downloaded the Terraform template declaring the [Azure Active Directory (AD) application registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#application-registration), [federated identity credential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identity-federation), and [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) for Snyk. Now you need to provision the infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

The process to create the Azure Active Directory app registration, federated identity credential, and service principal is the same whether you're using the Snyk Web UI or Snyk API to onboard your Azure subscription. Follow the instructions in [Step 2: Create the Azure AD app registration](../azure-integration-web-ui/step-2-create-the-azure-ad-app-registration.md), then return here to continue onboarding your project.

You can now proceed to [Step 3: Create and scan a Cloud Environment for Azure (API)](step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-for-azure-api.md).

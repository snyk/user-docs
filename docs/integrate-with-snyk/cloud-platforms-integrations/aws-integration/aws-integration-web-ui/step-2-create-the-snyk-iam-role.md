# Step 2: Create the Snyk IAM role

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have downloaded the Terraform or Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudFormation template declaring the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for Snyk. Now you need to provision the infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

The process to create the Snyk IAM role is the same whether you are using the [Snyk Web UI](step-1-download-iam-role-iac-template-web-ui.md) or [Snyk API](../aws-integration-api/step-1-download-iam-role-iac-template.md) to onboard your AWS account.

The IAM role you will provision has the following policies attached to it:

* The AWS-managed [SecurityAudit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access\_policies\_job-functions.html#jf\_security-auditor) read-only policy.
* A supplemental inline policy granting required read permissions not covered by SecurityAudit.

The role also has a trust policy that specifies an [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_roles\_create\_for-user\_externalid.html). Snyk generates this unique ID for your organization to prevent other parties from assuming the role without the ID, even if they have your role Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

## Create the IAM role with Terraform or CloudFormation

You can create the IAM role using one of the following tools, according to the type of template you downloaded from Snyk:

* **Terraform:** [Terraform CLI](step-2-create-the-snyk-iam-role.md#create-the-iam-role-with-terraform)
* **AWS CloudFormation:** [AWS CLI](step-2-create-the-snyk-iam-role.md#create-the-iam-role-with-aws-cli) or [AWS Management Console](step-2-create-the-snyk-iam-role.md#create-the-iam-role-using-the-aws-management-console)

### Create the IAM role with Terraform

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you use the [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads), ensure you [configure it to use your AWS credentials](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration).
{% endhint %}

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Snyk IAM role Terraform file (named `snyk-permissions-aws.tf` if it has been downloaded from the Snyk Web UI).
2. Using the Terraform CLI, initialize the Terraform Project:

```
terraform init
```

3\. Review and apply the Terraform plan:

```
terraform apply
```

4\. Enter `yes` when Terraform asks if you want to perform the actions.

Terraform then creates the IAM role. When the role has been created, you will see the following output:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

### Create the IAM role with AWS CLI

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), ensure you [configure it to use your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
{% endhint %}

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Snyk IAM role CloudFormation file (named `snyk-permissions-aws.yml` if it has been downloaded from the Snyk Web UI).
2. Using the AWS CLI, launch the CloudFormation stack, replacing `snyk-cloud-role` with the name of your IAM role if you changed it and `snyk-permissions-aws.yml` with the name of your file:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name snyk-cloud-role \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --template-body file://snyk-permissions-aws.yml
```

3\. AWS then creates the IAM role. This typically takes about a minute. To check if it is finished, get the stack status, replacing `snyk-cloud-role` with the name of your IAM role:

```
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name snyk-cloud-role \
  --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'
```

If the output says `"CREATE_COMPLETE"`, AWS has finished creating your role.

### Create the IAM role using the AWS Management Console

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Navigate to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).
3. Select the **Create stack** button:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk-cloud-cloudformation-create-stacks.png" alt="Select the Create stack button in the AWS Management Console"><figcaption><p>Select the Create stack button in the AWS Management Console</p></figcaption></figure>

4\. Select **With new resources (standard)** from the drop-down menu.

5\. On the **Create stack** page, in the **Specify template** section and select **Upload a template file**.

6\. Click the **Choose file** button that appears and select your CloudFormation file containing the Snyk IAM role.

7\. Select **Next**.

8\. On the **Specify stack details** page, in the **Stack name** section, enter a stack name, such as `snyk-cloud-role`.

9\. Select **Next**.

10\. On the **Configure stack options** page, enter tags if desired and keep the rest of the defaults.

11\. Select **Next**.

12\. On the **Review** page, in the **Capabilities** section at the bottom, check the box **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.**

13\. Select **Create stack**.

14\. AWS launches the stack, and you'll see a page with stack details. You can select the **Refresh** button to refresh its status:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk-cloud-stack-status.png" alt="Select the Refresh button to refresh the stack status in the AWS Management Console"><figcaption><p>Select the Refresh button to refresh the stack status in the AWS Management Console</p></figcaption></figure>

If the **Status** column says `CREATE_COMPLETE`, AWS has finished creating the IAM role.

## What's next?

The next step is to create and scan the Cloud Environment. See [Step 3: create and scan a Cloud Environment (Web UI)](step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-web-ui.md).

# Step 1: Download IAM role IaC template (Web UI)

Before you can create a Cloud Environment, you must download an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template declaring a read-only **Identity and Access Management** (IAM) role that Snyk can assume to scan the configuration of resources in your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

Use this IaC template to provision the role in [Step 2: Create the Snyk IAM role](step-2-create-the-snyk-iam-role.md).

You can choose the template format, either [Terraform HCL](https://www.terraform.io/language/syntax/configuration) or [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html). The IAM permissions are identical in both, so pick the format you are most comfortable working with.

The steps follow to **download the IaC template**.

1. In the [Snyk Web UI](https://app.snyk.io), navigate to **Integrations > Cloud platforms**.
2. Select **AWS**.
3. In the **Add AWS Environment** modal, select the **Terraform** button to download a `snyk-permissions-aws.tf` file or **CloudFormation** to download a `snyk-permissions-aws.yml` file:

You can also add a Cloud Environment from **Organization Settings (cog icon) > Cloud environments**. See [View Environments](../../../../scan-with-snyk/scan-infrastructure/getting-started-with-iac+-and-cloud-scans/snyk-environments/view-add-and-remove-environments.md#add-an-environment).
{% endhint %}

You can now proceed to [Step 2: Create the Snyk IAM role (Web UI)](step-2-create-the-snyk-iam-role.md).

# Google Cloud Integration: API

To onboard a Google Cloud Project to Snyk via the API:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template](step-1-download-service-account-iac-template-api.md) to give Snyk permissions to scan your account.
2. [Create a Google service account](step-2-create-the-google-service-account-api.md) using the template you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Cloud Environment.](step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-for-google-api.md)

When you have completed the steps, you will be able to do the following:

* View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See [Cloud and IaC+ issues](../../../../scan-with-snyk/scan-infrastructure/getting-started-with-iac+-and-cloud-scans/manage-iac+-and-cloud-issues/).
* Prioritize your vulnerabilities with cloud context.

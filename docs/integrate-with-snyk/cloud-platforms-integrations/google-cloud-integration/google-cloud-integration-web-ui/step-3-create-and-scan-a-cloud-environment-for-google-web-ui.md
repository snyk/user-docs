# Step 3: Create and scan a Cloud Environment for Google (Web UI)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have created the Google service account for Snyk. Now you can create and scan a Cloud Environment.
{% endhint %}

To create and scan a Cloud Environment for Google, you must provide the **Google service account's email address** and your **project ID**.

1. In the Snyk Web UI **Add Google Cloud Environment** modal where you downloaded the service account template, enter your service account email in the **Service account email** field.
2. Enter the identity provider in the **Identity provider** field
3. Optionally, enter an environment name. If one is not provided, Snyk will use your Google Project name.
4. Select **Approve and begin scan**.
5. You will see a confirmation message: **Google Cloud environment successfully added**. Select **Add another environment** to return to the **Add Google Cloud Environment** modal and onboard a new account, or select **Go to settings** if you are finished:

{% hint style="info" %}
It can take Google 60 seconds or more to create your service account. If you try to create an environment immediately after you create a service account and you receive a **could not validate credentials** error, wait at least 60 seconds and try again.
{% endhint %}

**What's next?**

You can now do the following:

* View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See [Cloud and IaC+ issues](../../../../scan-with-snyk/scan-infrastructure/getting-started-with-iac+-and-cloud-scans/manage-iac+-and-cloud-issues/).
* Prioritize your vulnerabilities with cloud context.

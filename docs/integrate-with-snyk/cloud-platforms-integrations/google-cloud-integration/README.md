# Google Cloud integration

Snyk integrations with your [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) Projects to find issues in your cloud configurations and generate cloud context to help you prioritize your vulnerabilities.

You can onboard a Google Cloud account to Snyk using the following methods:

* [Snyk Web UI](google-cloud-integration-web-ui/)
* [Snyk API](google-cloud-integration-api/)

## Prerequisites for Google Cloud integration

To add a Google Cloud integration, you need the following:

* A Snyk Group Administrator or Organization Administrator [role](broken-reference)
* Access to a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) project and associated credentials with permissions to create a read-only Google service account
* Access to the [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads), [configured with your Google credentials](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting\_started), to create the Google service account for Snyk
* **API only:** An Organization-level [service account](../../../enterprise-setup/service-accounts/) with an Org Admin role to use the Snyk API

# Managing integrations

When implementing a Snyk integration, you will decide whether to use a source control management (SCM) integration or a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) integration. See [SCM (Git) and CI/CD integration deployment intro](../git-repository-and-ci-cd-integrations-comparisons.md).

Administrators and account owners can:

* [Copy (clone) integrations](clone-an-integration-across-your-snyk-orgs.md)
* [Delete (disable) integrations](disable-a-git-integration.md)

In addition, administrators and account owners can use [service accounts](../../features/user-and-group-management/structure-account-for-high-application-performance/service-accounts.md) to configure integrations.

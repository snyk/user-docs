# Prerequisites

This workshop utilizes several technologies. We provide guidance for tools relevant to each module as we encounter them. This stepwise approach is intended to emphasize the tech in the right context.

This is a list of technologies we'll encounter across all module in the workshop:

* A [Snyk Account](../../../snyk-integrations/snyk-account.md) to see and review results.
* An [Amazon AWS Account](../../../aws-integrations/aws-account.md) for your cloud services and resources.
* [Atlassian Bitbucket](../../atlassian-bitbucket-account.md) for the Git repository.
* Atlassian Jira for Jira integration.
* The [Snyk CLI](../../../../snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli.md) to run local commands.
* In module steps, you will need to setup a Repository, [Bitbucket Pipelines](../../atlassian-bitbucket-pipeline-variables.md), and [Repository Variables](../../atlassian-bitbucket-pipeline-variables.md), and we'll describe those in [module-1-scanning-and-monitoring-source-code](module-1-scanning-and-monitoring-source-code/ "mention").
* [Amazon ECR](../../../aws-integrations/aws-ecr.md) the Container image you will name **java-goof.**
* [Amazon EKS](../../../aws-integrations/aws-eks.md) for running your Container.

You do not have to be an expert in these technologies, but as with most DevOps activities, the more experienced you are with tools and Linux environments, the more you can expect to get out of the examples.

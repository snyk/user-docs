# Configure GitHub integration

## Setting up a GitHub Integration

1. Go to the Integrations page and click on "GitHub".
2. Choose whether you'd like to give Snyk access to public and private repositories or only to public repositories (image 1).
3. When the GitHub authorization screen opens, click on "Authorize snyk" to provide it with access to your repositories (image 2).
4. Imported projects are continuously checked for vulnerabilities. We will import SPC in a future step.

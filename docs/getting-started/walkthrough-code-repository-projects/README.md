# Walkthrough: Code Repository Projects

## Introduction

This walkthrough shows how to use Snyk to scan, manage and fix application vulnerabilities in your Git-based code repository, using the [Snyk Web UI](../exploring-the-snyk-web-ui.md).

This walkthrough uses content imported from a GitHub repository. Snyk also supports other common Git-based repositories (such as GitLab and Azure), and items from all these repositories can be added to be scanned. See [Git repository integrations](../../integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/) for more details.

For general guidance about rolling out your Snyk solution to your teams, see [Implementing Snyk: Free and Team plan users](broken-reference/), or [Implementing Snyk: Enterprise plan users](broken-reference/).

### Prerequisites

This walkthrough assumes that you have followed the initial setup steps as described in the [Quickstart](../quickstart/) documentation (first [create a Snyk account](../quickstart/create-a-snyk-account/), then [set up an integration](../quickstart/set-up-an-integration.md) with a Git repo, and then [import a Project](../quickstart/import-a-project.md) containing items for scanning).

### First step: see your projects

Let's start by [viewing your first project](view-your-first-snyk-projects.md).

# Enable Snyk Code

## Introduction

[Snyk Code](../../../products/snyk-code/) enables your developers to scan their own application source code for issues.

For free plan users or users that have purchased Snyk Code as part of a paid plan, if you wish to scan your source code, you are prompted to allow source code scanning when you first sign up to Snyk and choose a code repository.

### Enabling Snyk Code

If you previously disabled/skipped this step, and now want to enable it, or you just want to confirm it’s available:

* Navigate to **Settings** > **Snyk Code**
* Click the toggle to enable Snyk Code
* Click **Save Changes**

If you imported Projects before enabling Snyk Code, you must re-import them.
{% endhint %}

See [Getting started with Snyk Code](../../../products/snyk-code/getting-started-with-snyk-code/) for more details.

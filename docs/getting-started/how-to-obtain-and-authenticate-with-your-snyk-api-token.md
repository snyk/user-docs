# How to obtain and authenticate with your Snyk API token

Your Snyk API token is a personal token available under your user profile. A token is required to authenticate with Snyk as an individual user and is also used in `SNYK_TOKEN` parameters. The Snyk API token is associated with your Snyk Account and not with a specific Organization.

Free, Team, and Trial plan users have access only to this personal token under the user profile. The **personal token can be used** to authenticate with:

* A CI/CD integration
* The Snyk CLI running on a local or a build machine
* An IDE, when setting a token manually

Enterprise users have access to a personal token under their profile and to service account tokens. For details, see [Service accounts](../enterprise-setup/service-accounts/).

* **Enterprise users should use a service account** to authenticate for any kind of automation. This includes, but is not limited to, CI/CD scanning with the CLI or build system plugins and automations, including the API.
* **Enterprise users should use the personal token** under their user profile for:
  * Running the CLI locally on their machine
  * Authenticating with the IDE manually
  * Running API calls one time, for example, to test something

For more information on the personal Snyk API token, see the following pages: [Authenticate the CLI with your account](../snyk-cli/authenticate-the-cli-with-your-account.md) and [Authentication for API](../snyk-api-info/authentication-for-api.md).

If you are using Snyk on the EU and AU tenants,  you must set your endpoints accordingly before authenticating. For more information, see [Regional hosting and data residency](../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md).

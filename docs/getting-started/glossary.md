# Glossary

## A

### Advisor

See [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/).

### **Asset (Snyk AppRisk)**

A Snyk AppRisk asset is an identifiable entity that is part of an application, and relevant for security and developers.

## B

### Base image

The parent image used to construct a container image, usually defined in the `FROM` directive in a Dockerfile. Base images themselves can be constructed from other base images.

### Broker

See [Snyk Broker](../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/).

### Build System

A system that takes the source code and builds the deployable application (such as a container).

## C

### CI/CD

Continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous deployment (CD) together comprise a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) model, guiding developers to automate the development and delivery of small, frequent changes. This ensures all team members have access to the latest codebase and can ensure the compatibility of committed code during development. See [Snyk CI/CD](../integrate-with-snyk/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/) for details of Snyk CI/CD integrations.

### **Class (Snyk AppRisk)**

A way to assign business context to assets and categorize an asset based on the business criticality. Assets can be assigned Classes A, B, C, or D, where Class A (assets that are business critical, deal with sensitive data, are subject to compliance, and so on) is the most important, and Class D (test apps, sandbox environments, and so on) the least important. Assets are assigned Class C by default. A class can be used in policies as well as defined in a policy.

### CLI

Command Line Interface. See [Snyk CLI](glossary.md#snyk-cli).

### Cloud Native Application Security

Implementing security throughout the CI/CD pipeline, automating security embedding in microservices, and maximizing repetition to reduce the introduction of vulnerabilities. Snyk provides a comprehensive [CNAS platform](https://snyk.io/product/cloud-native-application-security/).\
See the article [Cloud-native security guide for building secure applications](https://snyk.io/learn/cloud-native-security-for-cloud-native-applications/).

### Container

Containers allow you to package applications and their dependencies together to be deployed as a single runnable unit. A container is an abstraction provided by the operating system kernel that allows a process to be isolated from other processes running on the system. See also [Snyk Container.](glossary.md#snyk-container)

### Container engine

For users, an application that takes a container image and turns it into a running container. Container engines typically interface with container registries and run containers. Examples of container engines include Docker, CRI-O, and LXC.

### Container image

One or more files that, when instantiated by a container engine or runtime, provide a running container. Images are the packaging and distribution format for containers.

### Container registry

A server that provides a mechanism to store and retrieve container images.

### **Controls (Snyk AppRisk)**&#x20;

The security controls associated with the asset. Navigate to the Snyk AppRisk Controls section to see all available statuses for security controls.

### **Coverage (Snyk AppRisk)**

An assessment of whether applicable assets are scanned and tested by security tools (like Snyk Open Source, for instance), as it relates to an application security program. A type of policy that allows you to specify what controls should be applied and, optionally, how often it needs to be run.

### CVE

## D

### DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing. An application that you can point at a site or service; it then typically profiles the site or service, then examines the output and behavior to uncover security vulnerabilities. See also [SAST](glossary.md#sast).

### Dependency

When your application uses another package, this other package becomes a dependency in your own software.

* A direct dependency is a package you include in your own Project.
* An indirect dependency (also known as a deep, chained, or transitive dependency), is a package that is used by one of your direct dependencies.

### Dependency tree

Also known as Dependency path. A hierarchical graph showing the dependencies of a software application. This includes both direct and indirect dependencies and thus may be many levels deep.

### DevOps

A set of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that combines software development and IT operations to shorten the systems development lifecycle.

### DevSecOps

The integration of security into emerging agile IT and DevOps development as seamlessly and as transparently as possible.

### Dockerfile

A text file format used to build container images using Docker. The Dockerfile contains all the commands needed to construct the final image, including specifying the parent base image.

## E

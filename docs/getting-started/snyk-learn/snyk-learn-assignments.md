## Use cases for assignments

### Onboarding new employees

Ensure new employees complete their onboarding training within a designated timeframe. Assignments can include mandatory onboarding training content. The progress reset feature allows re-onboarding by clearing previous progress.

### Annual security awareness training

Mandate annual security awareness training for all employees. Assignments can span a specific year period and include relevant security education content. The admin can use the progress reset feature to reset last year’s progress for the new cycle.

### Product update training for the development team

Ensure developers are trained on new product features. Admins can create assignments that include product training content on new features. If significant updates require retraining, the admin can use the progress reset feature.

### Compliance training for new regulations

Ensure employees complete training on new regulatory requirements. Admins can create assignments that cover the effective period of new regulations, including content required by compliance. The admin can use the progress reset feature to reset previous progress and mandate updated training.

## Who can be assigned Snyk Learn lessons?

Snyk Learn requires users to have a Snyk Account. After a user has joined Snyk, they are available in the Snyk Learn UI for assignments.

Assignments are linked to the individual user.

## Who can create assignments?&#x20;

By default, only Snyk Org or Group admins can create assignments. Group admins can create custom roles by using the standard Snyk workflow. Learn more about the access controls for assignments at [Snyk Learn Access Controls](snyk-learn-access-controls.md).&#x20;

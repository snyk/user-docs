# Explore the Snyk Web UI

In the Snyk Web UI, you can manage your Projects, view and address security vulnerabilities, monitor dependencies, and review the health of your code. You can also configure account settings, manage API and Auth tokens, authorize applications, set organizational preferences, and customize email notifications.

You can visualize information at the Group or Organization level by clicking the name of the Group or Organization. General information, like Reports, Issues, Dependencies, Members, Settings, Help, and Settings, is available for all level types. For more information, see [Groups and Organizations](../snyk-admin/groups-and-organizations/).

## Group level

The following Snyk functions are available with the Web UI, at Group level, with Snyk Essentials:

* [Organizations available for the selected Group](snyk-web-ui.md#organizations-available-for-the-selected-group)
* [View the assets dashboard](snyk-web-ui.md#view-the-assets-dashboard)
* [View and manage your assets inventory](snyk-web-ui.md#view-and-manage-your-assets-inventory)
* [Manage and customize your policies](snyk-web-ui.md#manage-and-customize-your-policies)
* [Manage integrations for asset discovery, asset coverage, and issues from third-party vendors](snyk-web-ui.md#manage-integrations-for-asset-discovery-asset-coverage-and-issues-from-third-party-vendors)

### Organizations available for the selected Group

If you navigate to the Group level and select the Organizations page, you will see a list with all the Organizations that you have access to from that Group and the Organization role for each available Organization.

### View the assets dashboard

The Snyk Essentials Asset Dashboard reporting page provides a comprehensive overview of the security controls associated with your application. It presents critical metrics and data regarding your assets, such as scan coverage and a detailed breakdown of your inventory categorized by asset class, source, and other relevant information. Furthermore, the dashboard includes an extensive global filtering option, enabling users to filter results based on specific applications and owners, using the context data related to the application.

Navigate to the [Asset Dashboard](../manage-issues/reporting/available-snyk-reports.md#asset-dashboard) documentation section for more details.

### View and manage your assets inventory

You can use the [Inventory](../manage-assets/) page to organize your repository assets, enabling you to visualize all repository assets from your SCM tools, track Snyk product control coverage, and prioritize coverage mitigation based on business impact.

The Overview tab will provide quick insights into the discovered repositories. Scanned artifacts are not supported through Policies.

### Manage and customize your policies

For information on how to automate the process of adding business context and receiving notifications, see [Policies](../manage-risk/policies/assets-policies/).

### Manage integrations for asset discovery, asset coverage, and issues from third-party vendors

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

The **Integrations** page shows all active integrations, [SCM](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-scm-integrations/#group-level-snyk-apprisk-scm-integrations) or, [third-party](../integrate-with-snyk/#integrations-for-snyk-apprisk), including any data automatically synced from your existing Snyk Organizations, and provides access to the Integration Hub. You can use the Integrations Hub button to add SCM integrations, connect a third-party integration, add App Context to an SCM integration, or use the Snyk Runtime Sensor.

You can find an overview of all your integrations on the Snyk Web UI **Integrations** page. You can enable or disable your integrations, edit them, or remove them from your configuration.

#### Enable or disable an integration

You can have an integration connected or paused. Click play or pause to enable or disable an integration.

#### Add a new profile for an integration

Each integration can be configured to run on more than one profile. This is helpful when retrieving data from multiple instances within the same source.

To add a new profile:

1. Click the **Settings** icon from an already available integration profile.
2. Click **Add profile**.
3. Fill in the configuration fields and click **Done**.

#### Edit an integration

You can edit an existing integration by clicking **Settings** on the integrations card and then clicking **Settings** again on the added Organization for that integration.

### Explore the Dashboard

When you log in to an existing account and select an Organization, the Web UI opens the Dashboard for that Organization. You can see your top pending tasks and vulnerable Projects, and you can add new Projects.

#### Top pending tasks

The **Pending tasks** section shows the next chores to be handled for the Projects in a Snyk Organization.

#### View Projects

Use the links for Projects on the Dashboard to explore and manage the metadata, retest, and fix options for the Target files in your Projects. Each link opens a Project details page where you can view the Project **Overview**, or switch to the **History** and **Settings** tabs.

For more information, see [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/).

#### Fix vulnerabilities

Snyk tracks and flags Pull Requests (PRs) in the top-most vulnerable Projects, including:

* PRs that can be raised to fix vulnerabilities in some of the most vulnerable Projects.
* PRs that have already been raised by or through Snyk and are open and awaiting review.

For Projects with the **Fix vulnerabilities** link, use this link to view Project details with an option to open a fix PR. For details, see [Snyk Fix Pull or Merge Requests](../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/snyk-pull-or-merge-requests/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk tracks and flags PRs in GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Cloud only, and only for the top-most vulnerable Projects. If you use another SCM, the **Pending tasks** section shows PRs that can be raised but not PRs that have already been raised.
{% endhint %}

#### Top vulnerable projects

Similarly, the **top vulnerable projects** section shows the Snyk Projects assessed as the most vulnerable, with similar functions available as the **Pending tasks** section.

#### Add Project

To add a Snyk Project, use the **Add project** link on the Dashboard. Select how to add the Project from the dropdown. See [Import a Project](./#import-a-project-to-scan-and-identify-issues) for more details.

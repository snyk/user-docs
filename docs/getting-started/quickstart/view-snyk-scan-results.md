This shows the number of issues found, grouped by severity level (**C**ritical, **H**igh, **M**edium or **L**ow). See [Severity levels](../../manage-risk/priorities-for-fixing-issues/severity-levels.md) for more details.

The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

* Application code: see [Snyk Code](../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/getting-started-with-snyk-code/).
* Container images: see [Snyk Container](../../scan-containers/getting-started-with-snyk-container.md).

* Cloud misconfigurations: see [Snyk Cloud](../../scan-infrastructure/snyk-iac+/).

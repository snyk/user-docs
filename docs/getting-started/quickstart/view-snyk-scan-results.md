This shows the number of issues found, grouped by severity level (**C**ritical, **H**igh, **M**edium or **L**ow). See [Severity levels](../../scan-with-snyk/find-and-manage-priority-issues/severity-levels.md) for more details.

The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

* Open-source libraries: see [Snyk Open Source](../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-code/manage-code-vulnerabilities/view-vulnerabilities-in-your-code.md).
* Application code: see [Snyk Code](broken-reference).
* Container images: see [Snyk Container](../../scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/scan-container-images.md).
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform configuration files and cloud misconfigurations: see [Scan infrastructure](../../scan-with-snyk/scan-infrastructure/).

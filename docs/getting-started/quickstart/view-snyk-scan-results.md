This shows the number of issues found, grouped by severity level (**C**ritical, **H**igh, **M**edium or **L**ow). See [Severity levels](../../manage-issues/prioritizing-issues/severity-levels.md) for more details.

The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

* Open-source libraries: see [Snyk Open Source](broken-reference).
* Application code: see [Snyk Code](../../scan-using-snyk/start-scanning-using-the-cli-web-ui-or-api/scan-code/activate-snyk-code-using-the-web-ui.md).
* Container images: see [Snyk Container](../../scan-using-snyk/snyk-container/scan-container-images.md).
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform configuration files and cloud misconfigurations: see [Scan infrastructure](../../scan-using-snyk/scan-infrastructure/).

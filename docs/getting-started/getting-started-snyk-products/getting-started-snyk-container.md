# Getting started with Snyk Container

Get started with Snyk Container to help you find and fix vulnerabilities in container images. See [Container security overview](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003946897-Container-security-overview) and [Snyk Container](https://solutions.snyk.io/snyk-academy/container) for details.

{% hint style="info" %}
This process uses the Snyk.io UI. For details of Snyk Container using the Snyk CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool, see [snyk-cli-for-container-security](../../products/snyk-container/snyk-cli-for-container-security/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

* Access to a relevant container registry to use with Snyk. Snyk supports registries including , Amazon Elastic Container Registry ([ECR](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/image-scanning-library/ecr-image-scanning)), Google Container Registry ([GCR](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/image-scanning-library/gcr-image-scanning)), Microsoft Azure Container Registry ([ACR](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/image-scanning-library/acr-image-scanning)), and [JFrog Artifactory](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/image-scanning-library/jfrog-artifactory-image-scanning). Alternatively, access to [Kubernetes](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/image-scanning-library/kubernetes-workload-and-image-scanning) if you select that as an integration.
* A Snyk account (go to [https://snyk.io/](https://snyk.io) and sign up - see [Create a Snyk account](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/getting-started-snyk-products) for details).

## Stage 1: Add container registry integration

Choose a container registry integration, to connect the registry with Snyk:

1. Log in to Snyk.io
2. Select **Integrations**.
3. Select a **Container registries** entry.
4. Click the entry to integrate with Snyk.
5. Fill in the account credentials and other details as prompted, then save the changes, to integrate this entry with Snyk:

## Stage 2: Add projects

Add projects for your selected container, to start scanning with Snyk.

1. Click **Add Project**, and select the integration registry entry to add from:
2. Select the container repository and tags to import, then click **Add selected repositories** to import them into your projects. Importing also sets Snyk to run a daily check on the repositories for vulnerabilities.
3. A progress bar appears: click **View log** to see log results.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you encounter any errors during import, see the [Importing projects](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/sections/360000923478-Importing-projects) information.
{% endhint %}

## Stage 3: View vulnerabilities

You can now see vulnerability results for imported projects.

Select **Projects**, then click on the imported project entry under its registry record, to see vulnerability information for that project.

See [Analysis and fixes for your images from the Snyk app](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/getting-around-the-snyk-container-ui/analysis-and-remediation-for-your-images-from-the-snyk-app) for more details.

## Stage 4: Fix and review

1. Fix issues found, based on Snyk recommendations.
2. Rebuild your image.
3. Snyk automatically rescans your new image after it is pushed.

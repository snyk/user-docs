# Container security with ACR: integrate and test

Snyk integrates with Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR) to enable you to import your projects and monitor your containers for vulnerabilities, as is fully described in our Container vulnerability management documentation. Snyk tests the projects you’ve imported for any known security vulnerabilities found, testing at a frequency you control.

This document describes:

* Configure integration for ACR
* Add projects to Snyk

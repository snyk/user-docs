# Authentication

Snyk offers API tokens to enable integrations with third-party developer tools for authentication of your personal account, or alternatively in lieu of credentials to integrate a service account.

{% hint style="info" %}
For authentication purposes, the identity providers **do not require access to your repositories**, only your email address.
{% endhint %}

With Snyk, you can use one of the following identity providers for authentication:

* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* Google
* Azure
* Single Sign-On (SSO) - see [setting-up-sso-for-authentication](../setting-up-sso-for-authentication/ "mention")
* DockerID

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
Single sign-on is available with Enterprise and Business plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Logging in with a different provider than the one that you registered with when you first created your Snyk account will create a separate new Snyk account.
{% endhint %}

# What’s a Snyk organization?

An organization groups projects, and can have team members who can access these projects.

When you sign up to Snyk, you’ll see you have a default organization, named like your GitHub username. Any projects you add via the CLI or via GitHub integration will appear in this organization by default.

You can create an organization, or join one via invitation. If you have more than one organization, you can switch between organizations via the web UI or in the CLI.

Notifications about newly disclosed vulnerabilities are per organization; you can turn them on and off per organization.

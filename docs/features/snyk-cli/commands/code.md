### Configure the Snyk CLI

You can use environment variables to configure the Snyk CLI and also set variables to configure the Snyk CLI to connect with the Snyk API. See [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli).

### Debug

### Options

#### `--org=<ORG_NAME>`

Specify the `<ORG_NAME>`to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. The `<ORG_NAME>` influences private test limits.

If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=<ORG_NAME>`

Set a default to ensure all newly tested projects are tested under your default organization. If you need to override the default, use the `--org=<ORG_NAME>` option.

Default: `<ORG_NAME>` that is the current preferred organization in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account).

#### `--json`

Print results in JSON format.

#### `--sarif`

Return results in SARIF format.

#### `--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical`

Report only vulnerabilities at the specified level or higher. Note that the Snyk Code configuration issues do not currently use the `critical` severity level.

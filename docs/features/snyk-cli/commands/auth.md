# Auth

### Usage

`snyk auth [<API_TOKEN>] [<OPTIONS>]`

### Description

The `snyk auth` command authenticates your machine to associate the Snyk CLI with your Snyk account. Running `$ snyk auth` opens a browser window with prompts to log in to your Snyk account and authenticate. No repository permissions are needed at this stage, only your email address.

### Value

In some environments and configurations you must use the `<API_TOKEN>`; see [Authenticate the CLI with your account](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/authenticate-the-cli-with-your-account). The value may be a user token or a service account; see [Service accounts](https://docs.snyk.io/features/integrations/managing-integrations/service-accounts).

In a CI/CD environment use the `SNYK_TOKEN` environment variable; see [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli). After setting this environment variable you can use CLI commands.

### Debug

Use the `-d` option to output the debug logs.

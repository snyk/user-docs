# IAC

### Usage

`snyk iac <COMMAND> [<OPTIONS>] [<PATH>]`

### Description

The `snyk iac` command finds security issues in Infrastructure as Code files.

For more information see [Synk CLI for Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code).

### Command: `test`

Test for any known issue.

### Exit codes

Possible exit codes and their meaning:

**0**: success, no vulnerabilities found\
**1**: action\_needed, vulnerabilities found\
**2**: failure, try to re-run command\
**3**: failure, no supported projects detected\\

### Configure the Snyk CLI

You can use environment variables to configure the Snyk CLI and also set variables to configure the Snyk CLI to connect with the Snyk API. See [Configure the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli).

### Debug

Use the `-d` option to output the debug logs.

### Options

#### `--detection-depth=<DEPTH>`

Use with options as documented to indicate how many sub-directories to search. `DEPTH` must be a number.

Default: no limit.

Example: `--detection-depth=3` limits search to the specified directory (or the current directory if no `<PATH>` is specified) plus three levels of subdirectories.

#### `--org=<ORG_NAME>`

Specify the `<ORG_NAME>` to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. The \<ORG\_NAME> influences private test limits.

If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=<ORG_NAME>`

Set a default to ensure all newly tested projects are tested under your default organization. If you need to override the default, use the `--org=<ORG_NAME>` option.

Default: `<ORG_NAME>` that is the current preferred organization in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account).

#### `--ignore-policy`

Ignore all set policies, the current policy in the `.snyk` file, Org level ignores, and the project policy on snyk.io.

#### `--policy-path=<PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE>`

Manually pass a path to a `.snyk` policy file.

#### `--json`

Print results in JSON format.

#### `--json-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--json` option.

This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output using stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file.

#### `--sarif`

Return results in SARIF format.

#### `--sarif-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

Save test output in SARIF format directly to the \<OUTPUT\_FILE\_PATH> file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--sarif` option.

This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output using stdout and at the same time save the SARIF format output to a file.

#### `--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical`

Report only vulnerabilities at the specified level or higher.

#### `--scan=<TERRAFORM_PLAN_SCAN_MODE>`

Use this dedicated option for Terraform plan scanning modes to control whether the scan analyzes the full final state (for example, `planned-values`), or the proposed changes only (for example, `resource-changes`).

Default: If the `--scan` option is not specified, scan the proposed changes only by default. Example 1: `--scan=planned-values` (full state scan) Example 2: `--scan=resource-changes` (proposed changes scan)

#### `--rules=<PATH_TO_CUSTOM_RULES_BUNDLE>`

Use this dedicated option for Custom Rules scanning to enable the IaC scans to use a custom rules bundle generated with the `snyk-iac-rules` SDK. See [Download learn how to use the SDK](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-iac-rules).

This option cannot be used if the custom rules settings were configured with the Snyk UI. Default: If the `--rules` flag is not specified, scan the configuration files using the internal Snyk rules only.

Example: `--rules=bundle.tar.gz` (Scan the configuration files using custom rules and internal Snyk rules.)

### Examples for the iac test command

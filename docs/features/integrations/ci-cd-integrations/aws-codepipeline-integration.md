# AWS CodePipeline integration

Snyk integrates seamlessly with AWS CodePipeline to scan your application for open source security vulnerabilities and help you deliver secure applications via continuous delivery service. This integration allows CodePipeline users to make security an automated part of their build, test, and deploy phases.

{% hint style="info" %}
This integration is currently available in AWS’s `sa-east-1` | `ca-central-1` | `ap-southeast-2` | `ap-south-1` | `ap-northeast-2` | `ap-northeast-1` | `eu-west-3` | `eu-west-1` | `eu-north-1` | `us-east-1` | `us-west-2` | `eu-west-2` | `eu-central-1` regions. We are actively working on expanding to additional regions soon!
{% endhint %}

## Language Support

Snyk integration with AWS CodePipeline is supported for the following languages:

* JavaScript
* Java
* .NET
* Python
* Ruby
* PHP
* Scala
* Swift/Objective-C
* Go

## Setup

You can initiate Snyk’s AWS CodePipeline integration directly from the AWS CodePipeline console.\
Add Snyk to a new or existing pipeline using the following steps.

## Requirements

Check if your project must be built before the scan in the CodePipeline. If the project is needed to be built, you will need to add a CodeBuild step before the Snyk Step.

### CodeBuild Step Example

Please note the Scan's input artifact must be provided with the build's output artifact as shown in the configuration

Example of Javascript's CodeBuild (`buildspec.yml`):

```
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - npm install
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
```

Example of Maven CodeBuild (`buildspec.yml`):

```
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - mvn install
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
```

## Step 1: Add stage

At any point after the Source stage, you can add a Snyk scan stage, allowing you to test your application at different stages of the CI/CD pipeline.

Click **Edit**, and **Add a Scan Stage**.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/aws-cp-add-stage.png)

## Step 2: Add action group

Click **Add an Action Group** to open the **Edit Action** window:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/aws-cp-edit-action.png)

Name the action, then select **Snyk** as the **Action Provider**.

Click **Connect with Snyk** to begin the connection process.

## Step 3: Connect to Snyk

Select how you would like to authenticate with Snyk to give AWS CodePipeline permission to begin scanning your open source code.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk-cp-int-config.png)

## Step 4: Configure settings

The following options are available for configuration:

![Snyk AWS CodePipeline Configurations](../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk\_AWS\_CodePipeline\_Config\_y\_CodePipeline\_-\_AWS\_Developer\_Tools\_png.png)

* **Snyk Organization:** Select the Snyk organization where findings reports are saved.
* **Vulnerability handling**: To define the pipeline behaviour if a vulnerability is found. If the `Block deployment when Snyk finds an error` checkbox is checked, the pipeline will fail and not proceed to the next stage in the CodePipeline.
* **Block deployment for vulnerabilities with a minimum severity of**: (**low**|**medium**|**high**|**critical**) Only report vulnerabilities of provided level or higher.
*   **Monitoring behaviour on build**: Set the criteria to monitor projects from the AWS CodePipeline. The available options are:

    * **Always monitor**: The project snapshot is created independent of the test result.
    * **When test fails**: The project snapshot is created only in case the test fails.
    * **When test passes**: The project snapshot is created only when test is successful.
    * **Never monitor**: The project snapshot is never created.

    Unless the _**Never monitor**_ option is selected, please note that the _**Project to monitor**_ field is mandatory. This is to prevent any unintentional project overrides due to naming conflicts. The report is created associated with the selected _**Snyk organization**_.
* **Project to monitor**: Project group name for your projects. This is the same as using [remote-repo-url](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000910677-Snyk-CLI-monitored-projects-are-created-with-IDs-in-the-project-name) when using the CLI. The field does not allow any spaces in the names. It’s mandatory except if the `Never monitor` has been chosen in the previous field.
* **Auto-detect all projects in the working directory**: Check this checkbox to auto-detect all projects in the AWS CodePipeline. If not selected the plugin will test the first project is finds. Under the hood, it uses the `--all-projects` argument to detect all projects.
* **Advanced Options** (all of them are optional):
  * **Excluded directories**: This option will only appear when _**Auto-detect all projects**_ is checked. Indicate sub-directories to exclude, the directories must be comma-separated.
  * **Custom path to manifest file to test**: This option will only appear when the _**Auto-detect all projects**_ is not checked. You can specify the file path to manifest that Snyk should scan. When omitted Snyk will try to auto-detect the manifest file for your project.
  * **Additional Arguments:** A number of additional arguments are allowed, which will be applied to the test and monitor. The commands are as follows: `--dev`, `--detection-depth`, `--prune-repeated-subdependencies`, `--strict-out-of-sync`, `--yarn-workspaces`, `--skip-unresolved`. For more information on these commands, see [CLI Reference](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/cli-reference).

To change the configuration settings of a previously-configured stage, click the **Snyk** link.
{% endhint %}

Confirm the connection to Snyk when prompted.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/aws-cp-confirm-oauth.png)

Save the pipeline after successfully connecting to Snyk.

This configures your Snyk stage in the CodePipeline, so you can test your application. Users should release the latest changes through the CodePipeline options for the latest changes to take effect.

## View scan results

You can view scan results in the AWS CodePipeline console, by clicking **Details** in the Scan stage:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/aws-cp-findings-report.png)

Click **Link to execution details** to view your detailed vulnerability report.

## Test report details

Snyk analyzes the application’s manifest file and correlates the list of dependencies with Snyk’s vulnerability database. Snyk provides [detailed reports](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/categories/360000598418-Reports-and-remediation) for your open source code. By analyzing the application’s manifest file, Snyk builds a full dependency tree, accurately identifying both direct and transitive dependencies (transitives account for 78% of the vulnerabilities detected by Snyk). This enables Snyk to show exactly how a vulnerability was introduced into the application.

Reports are stored for 14 days before they expire. Subsequent pipeline runs will update the report and reset the retention period.

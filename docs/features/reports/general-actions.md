# General actions

This section describes the actions you can perform regardless of the tab you’ve selected.

## Filters

At the organization level, from the top of the Reports area, you can search for and filter specific projects, and you can filter projects by severity and type. Once you've filtered, the settings are retained as you navigate between tabs.

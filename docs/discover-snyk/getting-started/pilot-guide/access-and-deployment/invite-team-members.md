Alternatively, SSO can be configured as self-serve in the Group settings. More details on that can be found on the [Configure Self-Serve Single Sign-On (SSO)](../../../../implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/single-sign-on-sso-for-authentication-to-snyk/configure-self-serve-single-sign-on-sso/) page.

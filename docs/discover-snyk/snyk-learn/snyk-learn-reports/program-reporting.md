Snyk Learn provides a Snyk in-app reporting powered report to give you insights into your security training and education program.

## Learn Engagement report

You can use the data and insights to better optimise your program, find security champions, generate reports for compliance, and show progress to your executive sponsors. This report is available at the Group level.

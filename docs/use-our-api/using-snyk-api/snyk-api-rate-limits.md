# Snyk API rate limits

For [Snyk API v1](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/), each API has its own rate limit. The default is 2000 but some specific endpoints have lower limits. Refer to the reference docs for each endpoint to see the rate limits.

For [Snyk REST API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/), see Rate limiting in the reference docs overview.

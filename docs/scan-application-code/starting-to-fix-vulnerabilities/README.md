# Fix issues

Use this section to understand the core process of fixing vulnerabilities and licensing issues in your project.

### Introduction

Snyk helps you to fix vulnerabilities, by:

* [Upgrading the package](upgrading-package-versions-fix-vulnerabilities.md) to a vulnerability-free version.
* [Patching the vulnerability](snyk-patches-to-fix-vulnerabilities.md).

#### Applying fixes

To apply these fixes, you can use different methods, ranging from manually applying using the Snyk Web UI, to automatic pull requests opened by Snyk.

See [Fix your vulnerabilities](fix-your-vulnerabilities.md) for more details.

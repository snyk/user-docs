# Excluding directories and files from the import process

When you import a repository to be tested by Snyk Code, you can exclude certain directories and files from the import by using the **`.snyk`** file. The `.snyk` file is a YAML policy file that can contain shell matching patterns (regular expressions), which allow you to specify the directories and files you want to exclude from the import process. The `.snyk` file should be created in the repository you intend to import.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* In Snyk Code, the`.snyk` file can only be used to exclude directories and files from import. It cannot be used to ignore vulnerabilities or for any other action (as in other Snyk products).
* Currently, the **Exclude** option in the`.snyk` file applies only to the Snyk Web UI and CLI Environments. The **Exclude** option cannot be used when working with Snyk Code in an IDE environment.
* In certain situations, your excluded files may not be excluded if there is an invalid`.snyk` file. In these situations, the scan continues without the`.snyk` file.
{% endhint %}

You can also use the instructions in this section to exclude directories and files from the [Snyk Code CLI test](../../../cli-for-snyk-code/testing-your-source-code-via-the-cli.md), by creating the `.snyk` file in your tested repository.

### **The Exclusion Syntax of the .snyk File**

**Use the following syntax to exclude files and directories via the `.snyk` file:**

```shell
# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file

exclude:

# Use either “global” or “code”.
# “global” currently applies only to the Snyk Code product, and it will exclude the specified directories and files from these tests;
# “code” applies only to the Snyk Code analysis.

  global:
  
  # Exclude a single file. For example, - test.spec.js
  - "file_name.ext"
  
  # Exclude a single directory. For example, - src/lib
  - "source/directory_name"

  # Exclude any file with a specific extension in the specific directory. For example, - tests/.js
  - "directory_name/.ext"

  # Exclude files with a specific ending in any directory. For example,  - “/.spec.js”
  - "/.ending.ext"

  # Exclude files in directories that have the same name with a different ending, like “test” and “tests”.
  # The last character before the question mark is optional. For example, - tests?/
  - "directory_name?/"
  
  # Exclude all files and directories in a specific directory. For example, - tests/
  - "directory_name/**"
```

**Notes**:

* The path in the rule should be relative to the `.snyk` file location.
* All rules must have a preceding dash to be valid: - \<Exclusion\_rule>
* Any rule beginning with an asterisk must be wrapped in quotes. For example:\
  \- ”\*/src”
* Indentations –
  * When using the syntax in the `.snyk` YAML file, pay careful attention to new lines and their indentation. Using the wrong indentation will prevent the execution of your excluding specification.
  * Do NOT use tabs for indentation. Use only spaces for indentation.
  * To verify that you are using the syntax correctly, you can use a YAML Validator, like the [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/). Be aware that some YAML Validators do not differentiate between the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. If you use tabs, a Validator may approve the syntax, but the exclude specifications will not be executed.

### **Using the .snyk File to exclude directories and files from import**

**To exclude directories and files from the import process using the .snyk file:**

1\. On the repository you want to import, create a YAML file called “.**snyk**”.

For example:

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk Code - Exlude from Import - .snyk file creation - 2.png>)

2\. On the `.snyk` file, specify the directories and/or files you want to exclude from import according to the following syntax:

```yaml
# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file
exclude:
 global:
   - <Exclusion_rule>
   - <Exclusion_rule>
```

For example:

```yaml
# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file
exclude:
 global:
   - todolist-goof/** 
```

3\. From the Snyk Web UI, import your repository by one of the following ways:

* If the repository was already imported to Snyk – retest the repository as follows:
  * On the **Projects** page, click the **Code analysis** Project of the repository. Then, on the **Code Analysis** page, click the **Retest now** option below the header:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (213).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* If the repository was not imported yet to Snyk – [import the repository](importing-additional-repositories-to-snyk.md).

Your repository is imported to Snyk, without the directories and/or files you selected to exclude.

### **Example**: **Excluding 2 files from the Snyk Code analysis**

We have a repository called “**snyk-goof**”, which we want to test for vulnerabilities using Snyk Code. After we imported this repository to Snyk, we get a list of 10 detected vulnerability issues, which were found in 3 files:

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk Code - Exlude from Import - Example - Before Exclude.png>)

Now we want to exclude the **app.js** and **db.js** files from the Snyk Code analysis. To achieve that, we perform the following:

1\. We create a **`.snyk`** file in the **snyk-goof** repository in GitHub:

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk Code - Exlude from Import - Example - .snyk file creation.png>)

2\. In the `.snyk` file, we enter the following commands to exclude the **app.js** and **db.js** files from the import:

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk Code - Exlude from Import - Example - Command.png>)

3\. We retest the **snyk-goof** repository, by clicking the **Retest now** option on the **Code Analysis** page of the repository:

The **app.js** and **db.js** files are excluded from the retest, and therefore are not tested by Snyk Code. For this reason, they do not appear in the Code Analysis results, and now only 5 vulnerability issues are detected:

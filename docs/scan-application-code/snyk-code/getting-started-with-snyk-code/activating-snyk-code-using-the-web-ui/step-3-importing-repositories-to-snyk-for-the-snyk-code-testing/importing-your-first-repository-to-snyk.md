# Importing your first repository to Snyk

If your Snyk Account currently does not include any repositories, you need to import to Snyk the repositories you want to be analyzed and tested by Snyk Code.

**To import your first repository for the Snyk Code testing:**

1\. Open the Snyk Web UI, by going to [snyk.io](http://snyk.io), and clicking the **Log in** button.

2\. On the Snyk Web UI, select the **Projects** menu option:

**Note**: If your **Project** tab already contains Projects, use the instructions in one of the following sections:

* [Importing additional repositories to Snyk](importing-additional-repositories-to-snyk.md).
* [Re-importing existing repositories for the Snyk Code test](re-importing-existing-repositories-for-the-snyk-code-test.md).

3\. On the **Add your first project to scan for vulnerabilities** page - **Suggested Repositories** section, select the checkboxes of the repositories you want to test by Snyk Code:

**Note**: You can click the **Show all repositories** link to display all the repositories in your integrated SCM.

The selected repositories are imported to Snyk Code, and a progress bar appears:

When the import is completed, a confirmation message appears on the **Projects** page, informing you of the success of the import. Your imported repositories appear as Target folders, each containing the **Code analysis** Project that includes the findings of the Snyk Code test:

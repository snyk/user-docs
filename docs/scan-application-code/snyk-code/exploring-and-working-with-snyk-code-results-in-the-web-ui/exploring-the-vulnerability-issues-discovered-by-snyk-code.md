# Exploring the vulnerability issues discovered by Snyk Code

Each vulnerability issue that was discovered by Snyk Code contains the following details:

* **Severity level** - can be one of the following: **H**igh, **M**edium, or **L**ow.\
  **Note**: The Severity level of an issue in the Snyk Code analysis is defined mainly by the risk of the Sink of the potential vulnerability. For more information about the Source and Sink of an issue, see [Exploring the Data flow page](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-the-snyk-code-results/exploring-the-vulnerability-issues-discovered-by-snyk-code/exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-data-flow-page).
* **Vulnerability Type** - the type of security vulnerability or Security Rule that was discovered in the source code. In this example, “**SQL Injection**”.\
  **Note**: For the full list of Vulnerability Types/Security Rules that Snyk Code applies to your source code, see [Security Rules used by Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/security-rules-used-by-snyk-code).
* **Priority Score** - a number that is calculated and assigned by Snyk Code to each discovered issue, based on the severity level, risk, frequency, and ease of fix of the issue.\
  **Note**: For more information, see [Understanding the Priority Score of the Snyk Code issues](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-the-snyk-code-results/understanding-the-priority-score-of-the-snyk-code-issues).
* **CWE reference** - the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) ID of the specific Vulnerability Type, and a link to the CWE website, where this Vulnerability Type is described:

* **Code snippet** - the Sink area in the analyzed code, where the discovered vulnerability may be executed. To view the entire code snippet, click the **Full details** button to open the **Data flow** page.
* **Vulnerability overview** - a short description of the discovered vulnerability. To view the full description of the vulnerability, click the **Full details** button to open the **Data flow** page.
* **Link to** **the tainted source code in the integrated SCM** - a link to the vulnerable file in the SCM:

* \[If available] **Snyk Learn link** - a link to an article in [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io/), which provides detailed information from industry experts via interactive lessons on how to understand, fix, and avoid the discovered vulnerability.
* **Ignore** button - enables you to ignore this vulnerability issue.\
  **Note:** For more information, see [Ignore issues](https://docs.snyk.io/features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/ignore-issues).
* **Full details** button - enables you to open the [**Data flow**](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-the-snyk-code-results/exploring-the-vulnerability-issues-discovered-by-snyk-code/exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-data-flow-page) and [**Fix analysis**](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-the-snyk-code-results/exploring-the-vulnerability-issues-discovered-by-snyk-code/exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-fix-analysis-page) pages for more information on the discovered issue and fix recommendations and examples.

# Add Project tags and attributes

After importing your Projects, you can add metadata using [Project attributes](../../../snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md) or [Project tags](../../../snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-tags.md). This makes it easier to filter and report on specific subsets of your Organization.

For example, if you add both Project attributes including `frontend` and a tag of `Team:Unicorn` to all of your Projects that a specific Dev Team owns, you can easily generate a report of frontend critical vulnerabilities in production that team Unicorn owns.&#x20;

Attributes and tags are also useful features that can be used to configure [Project collections and Project views](../../../snyk-platform-administration/snyk-projects/project-collections-groupings/), making it easier for you to view Projects in a grouping that makes sense to you.

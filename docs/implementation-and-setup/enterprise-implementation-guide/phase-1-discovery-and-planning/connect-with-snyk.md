## Connect with your account manager

Before implementing Snyk, please contact your Snyk account manager to confirm you have the appropriate license for your use case. They can advise on the best license type and access level based on your business needs.

The proper license setup ensures you can fully use Snyk capabilities without limitations. It also guarantees you remain compliant with Snyk terms of use.

With the right license in hand, you are set for a smooth and successful experience using Snyk.

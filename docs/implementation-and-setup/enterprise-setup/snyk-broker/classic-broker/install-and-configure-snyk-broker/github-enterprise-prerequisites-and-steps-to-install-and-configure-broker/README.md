# GitHub Enterprise - prerequisites and steps to install and configure Broker

\
Before installing, **review the general instructions** for the installation method you plan to use, [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

The **prerequisites** follow.

Before installing the Snyk GitHub Enterprise Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.

You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.

**Continue** with the steps to install using [Docker](github-enterprise-install-and-configure-using-docker.md) or [Helm](github-enterprise-install-and-configure-using-helm.md).

Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

Before installing the Snyk Azure Repos Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.

You must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.

Continue with the steps to install using [Docker](azure-repos-install-and-configure-using-docker.md) or [Helm](azure-repos-install-and-configure-and-configure-using-helm.md).

# Choose a service account type to use with Snyk APIs

For certain Snyk API calls you must authenticate using an Organization or Group service account.

For example, use a Group service account token to call Group API endpoints and Organization API endpoints for all Organizations in the Group.

The Snyk API uses the same roles as the Snyk Web UI applications. Each Snyk action requires a set of user permissions to be present. For details, see [User roles](../../../snyk-platform-administration/user-roles/).

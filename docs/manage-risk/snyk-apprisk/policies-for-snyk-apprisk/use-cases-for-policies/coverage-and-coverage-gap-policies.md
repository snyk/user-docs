# Coverage and Coverage gap policies

You can use the Coverage filter to verify if an asset has ever been tested by the product and the Coverage gap filter to verify if the asset meets the coverage requirements set in a Set coverage control policy.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Coverage Gap filter is not the opposite of the Coverage filter.&#x20;

An asset can be covered (if it was scanned a month ago) but, at the same time, can still have a coverage gap, if the requirement is a daily scan.
{% endhint %}

## Main use cases

### Coverage

#### Include all selected products

Identify assets that have been scanned by both Snyk Code and Snyk OS simultaneously. Identifying these assets does not mean that they meet the coverage requirements.

### Coverage gap

#### Exclude all products

Identify all assets that are not part of the policy. For this, you must create a Coverage gap filter covering all the available products.

#### Filter non-compliant assets

Identify the assets that donâ€™t meet the coverage requirements of Snyk Code or Snyk OS, or both, simultaneously.

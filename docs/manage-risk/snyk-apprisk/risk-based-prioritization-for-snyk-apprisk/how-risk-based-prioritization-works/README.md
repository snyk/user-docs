# How risk-based prioritization works

Snyk AppRisk's risk-based prioritization capability relies on understanding your application context to help you better prioritize your security issues. It does that by understanding how your application is configured and relying on that information to provide you with specific [risk factors](risk-factors/).

* [Assets](assets.md) are analyzed by Snyk risk-based prioritization, focusing on images, Kubernetes resources, and packages to understand how they all interact with each other.
* [Risk factors](risk-factors/) are analyzed by Snyk risk-based prioritization and grouped into three main categories: OS conditions, Deployed, Public facing.

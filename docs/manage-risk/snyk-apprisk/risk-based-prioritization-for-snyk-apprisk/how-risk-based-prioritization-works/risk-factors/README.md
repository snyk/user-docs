# Risk factors

By understanding your images, packages, and Kubernetes resources as "application context", Snyk can compute the following risk factors:

* [OS condition](os-condition.md)
* [Deployed](deployed.md)
* [Public facing](public-facing.md)

You can enable and disable all of these "application context" risk factors through the Group **Settings**, on the **Insights** UI tab. If you choose to disable a risk factor, Snyk will no longer compute it.

Risk factor settings may take up to two hours to take effect.

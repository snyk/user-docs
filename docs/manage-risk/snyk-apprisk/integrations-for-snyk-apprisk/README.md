# Integrations for Snyk AppRisk

## Overview

The Integrations page shows all active integrations, including any data automatically synced from your existing Snyk Organizations, and provides access to the Integration Hub.

The following supported Snyk data are automatically synced:

* Snyk Open Source
* Snyk Code
* Snyk IaC
* Snyk Container&#x20;

Each connected integration enables you to:

* Pause data syncing
* Modify integration profiles and configurations
* Delete the integration
* Check when the integration was last synced and when the next sync is scheduled.

## Using the Integration Hub

Use the Integration Hub page to onboard integrations and populate Snyk AppRisk with data from SCM tools.

You can add an integration by following these steps:

1. Open AppRisk and navigate to the Integrations page.
2. Click **Integration Hub**.
3. Click **Add** on the integration you want to connect.
4. Configure your connection and click **Done**.

See the [Connect an SCM integration](connect-an-scm-integration.md) page for step-by-step details about how to set up an integration.

After the integration is validated, a card is displayed on the Integrations page, allowing you to enable or disable the connection, edit the settings, or remove the connection from your configuration.

## Using Snyk Broker

If your SCM instance is not publicly accessible, you need Snyk Broker. You can install and configure your Snyk Broker using Docker or Helm. For more information about Snyk Broker, see the Snyk Broker documentation, including [Snyk Broker - AppRisk](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-apprisk.md).

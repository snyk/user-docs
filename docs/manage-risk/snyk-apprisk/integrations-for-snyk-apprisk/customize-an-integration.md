## Add a new profile for an integration

Each integration can be configured to run on more than one profile. This is helpful when you want to retrieve data from multiple instances within the same source.&#x20;

You can add a new profile by following these steps:

1. Click on the Integrations settings icon.
2. Click **Add profile**.
3. Fill in the configuration fields and click **Done**.

## Remove an integration

Select an existing integration and click the Delete icon to remove it from your environment.

You cannot restore an integration that was already deleted. To add it again, you need to follow the steps from the [Using the Integration Hub](customize-an-integration.md#using-the-integration-hub) section.

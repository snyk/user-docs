# Evidence graph

{% hint style="info" %}
The evidence graph information is available only for Snyk AppRisk Pro users and it is visible only at the Group level.
{% endhint %}

The evidence graph is a visual representation of the risk factors for an issue and the path used by Snyk to identify the risk factors. If your issue has more than one identified risk factor, you can choose to see each specific path tied to every risk factor. The evidence graph also highlights the specific configuration of the affected image.

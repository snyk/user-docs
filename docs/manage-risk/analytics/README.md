Group members with reporting permissions can view their Groups on the Tenant-level analytics page.

Snyk restricts access based on Group-level permissions in both predefined and custom roles.

Users with Group reporting permissions can access Tenant-level analytics without Tenant-level roles, such as Tenant Admin or Tenant Viewer.

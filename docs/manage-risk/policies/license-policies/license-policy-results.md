# License policy results

A newly assigned policy, or modifications to a policy, will apply after the next scheduled test runs for all of the licenses in the Organization.&#x20;

If you change severity, results from scans are updated in the [Snyk Web UI](../../../getting-started/explore-snyk-through-the-web-ui.md), in [your IDE](../../../integrate-with-snyk/use-snyk-in-your-ide/), or in Snyk [PR Checks](../../../scan-with-snyk/run-pr-checks/).

Examples of results follow.

In the Snyk Web UI, **Dashboard** statistics are updated based on severity changes:

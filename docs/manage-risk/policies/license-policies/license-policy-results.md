# License policy results

A newly assigned policy, or modifications to a policy, will apply after the next scheduled test runs for all of the licenses in the Organization.

If you change severity, results from scans are updated in the Snyk Web UI, in [your IDE](../../../developer-tools/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/), or in Snyk [PR Checks](../../../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks/).

# Tagging policy - Use case

## Tagging policy

You can use the **Set Asset Tag** action to mark the repositories to which the filter criteria you have set apply.&#x20;

Snyk AppRisk has a number of pre-defined system tags that can be used for filtering and setting tags with policies. User-defined custom tags can be created using policies. You can create a Set Asset Tag policy action and define a custom tag by typing your tag in the tag search bar and selecting **Create new: `tag_name`**, for this example the `tag_name` being payment.

The following use case demonstrates how to apply the custom-defined `backend` tag to assets that match certain naming conventions. This allows a quick filter for backend assets from the Inventory view.

This is how the policy should look after you finish setting up all filters and actions.

# Manage risk

Snyk has several features to help you manage Application Security (AppSec) risk.

## Snyk AppRisk

[Snyk AppRisk](snyk-apprisk/) enables Application Security teams to run a full developer security program, covering use cases under Application Security Posture Management (ASPM).&#x20;

Snyk AppRisk provides:

* **Automated app asset discovery**: Continually discover application assets and classify them by business context, ensuring security is in sync with development.
* **Tailored security controls**: Define and manage appropriate security and compliance requirements, and verify the correct controls are in place.
* **Risk-based prioritization**: Meld application context with best-in-class security analysis and fix guidance to quantify risk for each app, and assure developer remediation effort is focused on issues that matter most to the business.

## Enterprise Analytics

[Enterprise Analytics](enterprise-analytics.md) shows the performance of a company's Application Security program.&#x20;

Metrics are reported for the pillars: Exposure, Manage, Prevention, and Coverage. The breakdown of open issues over time is shown in these categories: Baseline, Preventable, Non-preventable, and Other new.&#x20;

Customers can find the most serious problems that they must resolve, address those, and look for opportunities to proactively improve in each pillar.

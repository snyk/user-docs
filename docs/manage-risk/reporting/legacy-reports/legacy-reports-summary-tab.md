# Legacy reports summary tab

The main dashboard of the **Reports** area displays a birds-eye view of all of the issues (vulnerabilities and licenses) found across all of your projects, presenting data for these specific areas:

* Security issues
* License issues
* Your overall project activity—a summary of all of your projects, tests and issues

{% hint style="info" %}
Data in each tab appears based on the filters you've applied from the top of the Reports area, as well as the Group or Organization that you're viewing from.
{% endhint %}

To quickly view additional data for a specific period in time, hover over the relevant graph and check out the pop-up.

## **Summary tab elements**

The following table describes the different parts of the **Summary** area:

| Security issues  | <p>The number of vulnerabilities grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium or Low), including how many of them Snyk identifies as auto fixable.</p><p>Click a number to navigate to the <a href="legacy-reports-issues-tab.md"><strong>Issues</strong> tab</a>, filtered to show vulnerabilities for the selected severity only.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Activity

For the **Activity** area, the following are the parameters and their descriptions:

| Tests run               | Number of tests run. By default, Snyk scans most Projects daily, so an Organization with 100 projects would generate 9,000 scans over 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Ignored issues          | <p>The total number of the issues found, but ignored, as well as the total number of ignored issues that have a fix available. These are issues not counted in any of the other totals in this <strong>Summary</strong> area.</p><p>Click the number in the <strong>Ignored</strong> issues box to jump to the <strong>Issues</strong> tab, filtered to those ignored issues only. Clicking on the fixable number from the same box navigates to the <strong>Issues</strong> tab, filtered to those fixable, yet ignored, issues only.<br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After you ignore an issue, it may take up to one hour before synchronizing with the data on the Summary tab of the Reports.</p> |

## **Filtering results**

If you have lots of Projects files to manage and organise in your Organization, you can use filters to focus on specific Projects, or specific types of vulnerability:

<figure><img src="broken-reference" alt="Filter results"><figcaption><p>Filter results</p></figcaption></figure>

For example, if your Organization represents your development team, and you want to focus on (say) front-end work in the next Sprint, click the **Projects** dropdown and select a subset of the front-end Projects to scan, allowing you to focus on fixing vulnerabilities in that area.

# Data Share data dictionary

Snyk Data Share is a comprehensive dataset encompassing various data pillars that support a wide range of use cases. You can use this dataset to present key security metrics such as issue backlog, aging, MTTR, SLA compliance, and test coverage, as well as to prioritize issues based on different factors, such as risk score, severity, CVSS, EPSS, and many more.

This dictionary is designed to help you navigate the dataset efficiently. It provides clear explanations of the purpose of each table and the specific data contained in each column, enabling you to leverage the  dataset to meet your data reporting needs.

### Issues

> Version in use: v1.0

The `ISSUES` table contains various attributes of Snyk Issues. Issues can be easily correlated with their originating Project, target, Organization or Group, utilizing the corresponding ID columns. On top of the issue's basic attributes, such as its introduction date, type, severity, score, there are columns that elaborate on the vulnerability attributes, such as the CVSS score, EPSS Score, NVD Score.

Querying the issues table allows:

* Concluding various metrics and KPIs, among issue backlog, aging, MTTR and SLA compliance.
* Visualizing trends of identified, ignored, and resolved issues over time
* Prioritize issues based on multiple factors and considerations

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to match your results with Snyk Reports:&#x20;

* Filter your query with `DELETED_AT IS NULL`, as Snyk Reports do not present deleted issues.

### Usage Events

> Version in use: v1.0

The `USAGE_EVENTS` table contains CLI interaction data that is collected from Snyk's CLI interfaces (CLI, IDE plugins, CI/CD pipeline tools). The CLI interaction events can be correlated with the execution context, such as their target, Organization, or Group, utilizing the corresponding ID columns.

Querying the `USAGE_EVENTS` table allows you to measure:

* Developers' usage and adoption of Snyk IDE plugins
* Snyk tests in CI/CD pipelines
* Snyk CLI utilization per the different commands: test, monitor, SBOM, etc.

### Issue Jira Issues

> Version in use: v1.0

The `ISSUE_JIRA_ISSUES` table allows correlation between Snyk issues and assigned Jira issues. As Snyk enables more than one type of Jira integration, it is important to emphasize that the Jira issues that are available in the dataset originated from this [Jira integration](../../../integrate-with-snyk/jira-and-slack-integrations/jira-integration.md).

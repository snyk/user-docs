# Overview

Snyk has several features to help you manage Application Security (AppSec) risk.

## Snyk Essentials

Snyk Essentials provides a powerful set of tools to enhance application security management, including thorough vulnerability detection, easy integration, and effective remediation processes for improved security throughout the development lifecycle. See the [Snyk Essentials ](../scan-with-snyk/snyk-essentials.md)page for more details.

## Analytics

[Analytics](analytics/) shows the performance of a company's Application Security program.

Metrics are reported for the pillars: Exposure, Manage, Prevention, and Coverage. The breakdown of open issues over time is shown in these categories: Baseline, Preventable, Non-preventable, and Other new.

Customers can find the most serious problems that they must resolve, address those, and look for opportunities to proactively improve in each pillar.
